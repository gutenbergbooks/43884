<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>From the founding of the first permanent English settlement in America at
Jamestown to the present-day launching of the country's largest ships at Hampton
Roads, the name "Virginia" suggests a geographical area which has formed the
background for innumerable local, state, national and international events. An
understanding of "The Life of Virginia"&mdash;geographical, historical, economic,
cultural and political phases of living&mdash;should result in a better appreciation of
the unique role played by Virginia in the development and progress of the United
States of America.</p>

Geographical Life</h2>

<h3><em>Location and Topographical Regions</em></h3>


<p>The Commonwealth of Virginia is located in the eastern part of the United
States, approximately midway between the North and the South, and it is
classified geographically as a South Atlantic State. The shape of the state suggests
an irregular triangle: the base of the triangle, the southern boundary of the state
which divides it from North Carolina and Tennessee; the left side or western side,
dominated by the Blue Ridge, the Appalachian and the Allegheny Mountains;
and the right side or eastern side, the Coastal Plain.</p>

<p>Virginia is bounded on the north by West Virginia, Maryland and the Potomac
River which forms the boundary between Virginia and Maryland and Virginia
and the District of Columbia; on the east by the Potomac River, Maryland, the
Chesapeake Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean; on the south by North Carolina and
Tennessee; and on the west by Kentucky and West Virginia.</p>

<p>The area of the state is approximately 40,815 square miles. This area places
Virginia thirty-sixth in rank in area among the States of the Union. Approximately
2,000 square miles of this area consist of water. The southern boundary
extends approximately 450 miles from east to west and the distance from north
to south is approximately 200 miles at its widest point. The geographical center
of Virginia is at a point eleven miles south of east of the town of Amherst in
Appomattox County. The highest point is Mount Rogers located in Smyth and
Grayson Counties with an elevation of 5,719 feet. The lowest altitude is sea
level along the Atlantic Coast. The average elevation of the state is 950 feet.</p>

<p>Topographically, Virginia may be conveniently divided into five major regions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) the South Atlantic Coastal Plain&mdash;As the name suggests, this region
extends along the coast from the Atlantic Ocean to the Fall Line Zone. The
Fall Line Zone refers to a section where the streams pass from the rocky areas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the mountain region or high land to the level area or low land; at such points,
falls or rapids develop. The Great Falls of the Potomac in Maryland and in
Virginia, the Falls of the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg, the rapids of the
James River at Richmond and the Falls of the Appomattox at Petersburg illustrate
the concept of the Fall Line. Consequently, the so-called Fall Line extends
from Washington, D. C., through Alexandria, Fredericksburg, Richmond,
Petersburg and Emporia in Virginia. Thus, the South Atlantic Coastal Plain
region of Virginia is located along the Atlantic seacoast from the Potomac
River at Alexandria to the North Carolina boundary line and as far west as
the Fall Line Zone. The width of this area varies from 35 miles to 120 miles.
This region is also called "Tidewater" Virginia because the level land here is so
low that the ocean tides may often be seen in the inland streams. "Tidewater"
Virginia includes five peninsulas formed by the Chesapeake Bay, the Potomac,
the Rappahannock, the York and the James Rivers. These five peninsulas are:</p>

<p>a. the Eastern Shore&mdash;Although most of Tidewater Virginia is located on
the western side of the Chesapeake Bay, a unique peninsula called the Eastern
Shore extends southward from Maryland and is separated from the rest of
Virginia by the Chesapeake Bay. Thus, in order to travel by land from the
mainland of eastern Virginia to the Eastern Shore, it is necessary to travel via
Maryland.</p>

<p>b. the Northern Neck&mdash;This peninsula lies between the Potomac and the
Rappahannock Rivers and is only 22 miles at its widest point.</p>

<p>c. the Middle Peninsula&mdash;This peninsula lies between the Rappahannock
and the York Rivers.</p>

<p>d. the Peninsula of the Lower York-James Peninsula or the Williamsburg
Peninsula&mdash;This peninsula is located between the York and James Rivers.</p>

<p>e. the Norfolk Peninsula&mdash;This peninsula is located between the James
River and the Virginia-North Carolina boundary line. In general, the land in
this region is a flat plain. The tidal rivers mentioned previously are actually
estuaries of Chesapeake Bay and they flow periodically inland. Therefore, they
are an unusual combination of waters from the Bay itself and from the Atlantic
Ocean whose pressure pushes the tides inland. The strong influence of geography
upon occupations in this region is exemplified by the importance of
commercial fishing (especially oysters, scallops, clams and crabs), ocean transportation
(the large area of deep water in the Chesapeake Bay encourages
ocean-going commercial ships to seek inland ports in this region&mdash;especially
around Hampton Roads), truck farming (the clay loam soil and the sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
loam soil here provide excellent productivity of potatoes, early vegetables, corn
and hay), and the manufacturing of fertilizer (particularly from fish and fish
scraps), bricks (an abundance of sand and gravel encourages the making of
bricks), pulpwood, railroad ties, barrel staves and other lumber products (60%
of the Tidewater area is covered with forests).</p>

<p>(2) the Piedmont Plateau&mdash;This region extends from the Coastal Plain
westward to the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The word "Piedmont"
literally means "at the foot of the mountain." A plateau is defined as a high
lowland; therefore, this section is higher in elevation than the Coastal Plain
region. This area is characterized by rolling hills and many swift streams. The
width of the plateau varies from forty miles in Northern Virginia to one hundred
ninety miles in the southern part, gradually broadening as one travels
southward. The plateau rises gradually from an elevation of 200-700 feet at
the eastern end of the plateau until, at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains,
it reaches approximately 1500 feet near the Virginia-North Carolina border.
The Piedmont area located south of the James River is known as the Southside.
Agriculture is the chief occupation because, in general, this land is fertile due
to the presence of limestone soils and clay deposits. Large amounts of tobacco
are grown here. The Piedmont also has a great variety of rocks, including
granite and soapstone which are currently commercially important.</p>

<p>(3) the Blue Ridge and Valleys&mdash;Although the Blue Ridge Mountains are
a part of the Appalachian Range, they are, geographically, sufficiently significant
to afford them a separate listing in a topographical description of Virginia.
The Blue Ridge Mountains, located between the Potomac and the Roanoke
Rivers, cross Virginia in a northeast-southwest direction and are from three to
twenty miles wide. The Blue Ridge of Virginia originates at the junction of the
Potomac and the Shenandoah Rivers and continues southwestward to the North
Carolina line. From a distance the mountain ridges usually appear to be covered
with a blue haze; therefore, the term "Blue Ridge" is believed to have
originated from such an observation in early colonial Virginia days. This region
constitutes a distinct contrast to the Piedmont area since the ridges appear
abrupt yet lofty in height: in the northern half of Virginia, Stony Man Ridge
(4,010 feet) and Hawksbill (4,049 feet); in the central part, Peaks of Otter
(Flat Top&mdash;4,001 feet and Sharp Top&mdash;3,875 feet) and in the southwestern
part, White Top Mountain (5,520 feet) and Mount Rogers (5,719 feet), the
highest point in Virginia. In the southern part, the Blue Ridge becomes a
rugged plateau with stony land and jagged ravines unsuited for commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
agricultural pursuits. This entire area is heavily forested with white pine, white
oak, poplar, hemlock, black oak, yellow pine, chestnut, locust and chestnut oak
trees. The famous Skyline Drive in the Shenandoah National Park extends
one hundred miles along the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains in this area
from Front Royal to Waynesboro.</p>

<p>(4) the Appalachian Ridge and Valleys&mdash;This region is located west of the
Blue Ridge and Valleys. The Appalachian Ridge consists primarily of a narrow
strip of land thirty-five to one hundred miles wide. The Allegheny Mountains
border Virginia along the west and numerous high, narrow ridges are found
here. The Appalachian Valley in Virginia, like the Blue Ridge, originates at
the junction of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers. This valley extends for
approximately three hundred and fifty miles to the borderline of Tennessee.
The eastern part of this valley is often referred to as the Great Valley or the
Valley of Virginia. This valley is actually a series of valleys separated by crosswise
ridges and drained by five rivers: the upper James, Roanoke, New, Holston
and Powell. An abundance of limestone makes the soil exceptionally fertile and
productive. In the northern part of the Valley of Virginia is the famous Shenandoah
Valley, about 150 miles long and ten to twenty miles wide, divided
in the north by the Massanutten Mountain, a high ridge approximately forty-five
miles long. There is a great variety of soils found here, and most of them
have a fair degree of plant fertility. Corn and winter wheat are the agricultural
specialties of the Shenandoah Valley. Other valleys included in the Valley of
Virginia are the Abingdon Valley, Dublin Valley, Fincastle Valley, Powell
Valley, Roanoke Valley, New River Valley, Holston Valley and Clinch Valley.</p>

<p>(5) the Appalachian Plateau&mdash;This region is located in southwestern Virginia
and is often referred to as the Southwestern Plateau or Allegheny Plateau.
It extends only a short distance into Virginia and consists mainly of rough,
rugged terrain. Water gaps, gorges, sandstone walls, rock formations and dense
forested areas make southwestern Virginia's scenery distinctly different and
picturesque. The Cumberland Mountains form its western boundary. Coal-mining
is the chief occupation in this region, and this is the area where the
largest and most productive coal-fields of Virginia are located. Lumbering is
also carried on extensively. In addition, some cattle, hogs, corn and vegetables
are raised here.</p></blockquote>

<p>The combination of these five regions suggests a one-word description of Virginia's
topography, namely, diversified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Unique Features</em></h3>

<p>Each state of the United States generally has at least a few geographical oddities
or unusual geographical formations. Virginia has been richly endowed with
caverns, springs, unusual rock formations and a dense, swampy wilderness.</p>

<p>The chief caverns are called Endless (near New Market), Grand (at Grottoes),
Luray (near Luray)&mdash;the largest in Virginia, Massanutten (near Harrisonburg),
Melrose (near Harrisonburg), Shenandoah (near New Market) and Skyline
(near Front Royal). These caverns are of limestone formation and contain stalagmites
(upward-projecting forms on a cavern floor) and stalactites (downward-projecting
forms from a cavern ceiling) in diverse shapes and colors. The Blowing
Cave in Bath County received its name from the inhalation of cold air during
the winter and the expulsion of cold air during the summer.</p>

<p>Burning Spring is located in Wise County and is so named because of the
liquid flames which seethe through the surface of the earth in this area from
unknown sources. Crystal Spring in Roanoke received its name from the approximately
five million gallons of crystal water per day which likewise appear from
some unknown source.</p>

<p>The famous Natural Bridge of Virginia is considered one of the seven natural
wonders of the new world. It is located near Lexington in Rockbridge County
(the county so-named because of the existence of the bridge of rock) and is a
bridge of stone ninety feet long and two hundred and fifteen feet high spanning
a gorge cut by Cedar Creek. So unique is this formation that Indian lore relates
that it was referred to as "the Bridge of God." In this same region, in Patrick
County, may be seen crystals in the shape of crosses in certain rock strata. So
rare is their structure and clarity that they are often called "Fairy Stones" or
"Cross Stones."</p>

<p>The Natural Tunnel located in Purchase Ridge near Big Stone Gap and Bristol
is a tunnel approximately nine hundred feet long, one hundred and fifty feet wide
and one hundred feet high, carved by flowing water through solid mountain
terrain. The tunnel itself includes a reverse curve, and, at the present time, railroad
tracks and Stock Creek waters run through it.</p>

<p>Crabtree Falls in Nelson County, Central Virginia, is believed to be one of
the highest waterfalls east of the Mississippi River. These falls are formed by a
branch of the Tye River, the South Fork, descending two thousand feet below in
cascade formation.</p>

<p>The Great Falls of the Potomac, located on the boundary between Virginia
and Maryland, is one of the highest waterfalls east of the Rockies with an elevation
of ninety feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The Natural Chimneys located at Mt. Solon are seven large towers of stone
carved by erosion out of a mountain. These rock strata are so straight and so
symmetrical that they resemble a series of chimneys suggesting their name. Two
of the chimneys have tunnels carved through the bases, and cedar trees appear to
grow out of the rock.</p>

<p>The Great Dismal Swamp, approximately fifteen hundred square miles in area,
is shared by Virginia and by North Carolina. It is noted for its dense tropical
growth, its fur-bearing game (particularly, black bear), its massive timber varieties
and its disorderly plant vegetation. Juniper trees, sometimes called red cedar, and
cypress trees are abundant around Lake Drummond in the Great Dismal Swamp.
The swamp is more easily accessible from Virginia than from North Carolina.</p>

<p>In addition to the above natural wonders, there are numerous mineral springs,
canyons, mountain peaks and deep gorges. Virginia has nine State Parks including
Douthat State Park (near Clifton Forge), Fairystone State Park (near Bassett
and Martinsville), Hungry Mother State Park (near Marion), Seashore State
Park (near Cape Henry), Staunton River State Park (near South Boston and
Halifax), Westmoreland State Park (near Montross and Fredericksburg), Claytor
Lake State Park (near Dublin and Radford), Prince Edward Lake State Park
(near Burkeville) and Pocahontas Memorial State Park (near Richmond and
Petersburg). The Breaks Interstate Park controlled by Virginia and Kentucky
has scenery so similar to the Grand Canyon that it is often refered to as "The
Grand Canyon of the South." The Virginia area of the Breaks is located in the
northern part of Dickenson County. Virginia also has a prominent National Park,
Shenandoah National Park, established in 1935, which consists of approximately
193,000 acres. This park includes the beautiful Skyline Drive. Cumberland Gap
National Historical Park is located in parts of Kentucky and Tennessee as well
as in Virginia.</p>


<h3><em>Rivers and Lakes</em></h3>

<p>Because of the varied topography, there are many swift streams which are
available (although not yet completely utilized) for water power. Virginia has
parts of eight different river systems within its boundaries. They are the Potomac
River (including its chief tributary, the Shenandoah), the Rappahannock River
(including its chief tributary, the Rapidan), the York River, the James River
(including its tributaries, the Chickahominy and the Appomattox), the Meherrin,
Nottoway and Blackwater Rivers (the chief tributaries of the Chowan River in
North Carolina), the Roanoke River (including its chief tributary, the Dan),
the New River and the Holston, Clinch and Powell Rivers (the chief tributaries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the Tennessee River System). These rivers furnish excellent waterpower and
drainage.</p>

<p>In addition to these important rivers, Virginia has several valuable lakes. Included
among these are: Crystal Lake near Cape Henry, Lake Drummond (the
largest body of fresh water in the state, approximately five square miles in area
and twenty-two feet in altitude) in the heart of the Dismal Swamp and in the
highest part of the Dismal Swamp, Lake Jackson near Centerville, Mountain Lake
near Blacksburg (thirty-five hundred feet above sea level and noted for the clarity
of its water), Pedlar Lake in Long Mountain Wayside Park, Claytor Lake near
Pulaski, Bear Creek Lake near Richmond, Bedford Lake at Bedford and Prince
Edward Lake in Prince Edward State Park. Some of these lakes are noted for
their fish, especially bass and trout, while others contribute primarily to the scenic
grandeur of Virginia.</p>


<h3><em>Climate</em></h3>

<p>The climate of Virginia is classified as continental&mdash;characterized by frequent
moderate extremes in temperature and a medium length summer growing season.
Since elevation generally affects climatic conditions, the temperature in the Piedmont
Plateau and Appalachian Ridge sections varies according to the altitude.
In the Piedmont and Appalachian areas, during the winter months the temperatures
are lower than on the plains; likewise, in the former areas, greater seasonal
contrasts occur. In general, the climate of the entire state is mild with few
extremes in temperature. The average temperature is approximately 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, winter; 60 degrees Fahrenheit, spring and fall; and 80 degrees Fahrenheit,
summer. The greatest ranges of temperature occur in the Piedmont and in
the Great Valley. Snow falls very infrequently except in the mountain areas and
usually is of short duration whenever it appears.</p>

<p>With respect to annual precipitation, the average rainfall for Virginia is approximately
forty-five inches, with variations in different regions. In some regions
it is as high as forty-nine or fifty inches and, in others, as low as thirty-six or
thirty-seven inches. Rainfall typically is abundant and well-distributed throughout
the year. The heaviest rainfall usually occurs, however, during the summer. As
a result of the climatic conditions of temperature and precipitation, the growing
season varies from approximately one hundred and fifty to two hundred and ten
days. Consequently, agricultural products are well diversified.</p>


<h3><em>Natural Resources</em></h3>

<p>The economic destiny of a region is greatly influenced by its natural resources
as well as by its location. It has already been pointed out that Virginia has a
most desirable location. Virginia also has numerous natural resources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>One resource so influential that it often shapes the economic pattern of a state
is soil. Virginia is fortunate in having numerous types of soil: rich, black loam;
light, sandy loam; clay and sand loam; limestone and clay soils. Most of these
soils are easily adaptable to cultivation, and the use of crop rotation and of marl
(a soil neutralizer) has fostered extensive production.</p>

<p>Forests constitute approximately three-fifths or 60% of Virginia's total land
area. There are many hardwood and softwood varieties in Virginia. The term,
"hardwood," is sometimes a misleading one because a few of the so-called "softwood"
trees are actually hard in substance. Hardwood trees shed their leaves
annually, and they are called deciduous trees. Since softwood trees bear cones,
they are called coniferous trees. The southern or yellow pine is the leading softwood
or coniferous tree which thrives in Virginia because of the sandy soil of the
coastal plain. Other softwoods are red spruce, hemlock, red cedar and cypress.
Hardwoods include oak, chestnut, locust, hickory, walnut, gum, white ash, magnolia
and dogwood. Although the forests are scattered throughout the state, the
Tidewater, Piedmont and western portions of the state have the largest forested
area.</p>

<p>Fish are plentiful in Virginia because of the Atlantic Ocean, the Chesapeake
Bay and the numerous rivers and mountain streams. Virginia usually ranks annually
among the first ten states in the value of its fisheries. The principal fish are
oysters and clams in Chesapeake Bay, blue crabs and shrimp in the Tidewater
area, scallops in seacoast inlets, bads, bream, perch, pike, carp, catfish in inland
waters and speckled and rainbow trout in mountain streams. Menhaden fish,
found near the surface of the water, are inedible but are now being used for
making fertilizer and oil in Virginia.</p>

<p>The amount of waterpower is above average in Virginia due to many swift
streams and rivers and the high elevation. This resource combined with an ample
supply of steam coal has resulted in the production of electric power in Virginia
at a much cheaper rate than in many other states. Furthermore, it is estimated
that Virginia industry at the present time is using only approximately 10 per cent
of its available waterpower supply.</p>

<p>With respect to minerals, approximately one hundred and fifty kinds have been
found in Virginia, and approximately forty have been mined and quarried recently.
However, Virginia ranks nineteenth in United States mineral production and
provides approximately 1.25% of the total United States mineral value.</p>

<p>The most valuable and most abundant mineral resource found in Virginia is
coal. There are four types: bituminous (soft), anthracite (hard), semi-bituminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and semi-anthracite. The bituminous coal far surpasses the other types in quantity.
The coal supply is found primarily in three areas: (1) the Piedmont region&mdash;the
Richmond Basin and the Farmville area&mdash;bituminous; (2) the west side
of the Great Valley of Virginia&mdash;anthracite and semi-anthracite and (3) the
Southwestern Plateau&mdash;bituminous and semi-bituminous. The first coal to be
mined in the United States was located near Richmond in 1745. At the present
time, Virginia ranks sixth in the United States coal production and is believed
to have more coal seams now available than any other mining district in the
United States. Coal is mined most frequently in Buchanan, Wise and Dickenson
Counties.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Various types of stone resources rank second in financial value of minerals.

sidewalks, flagstones and asphalt shingles</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several miscellaneous minerals which, when combined, rank third
in financial value of minerals in the state. These miscellaneous minerals include:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Aplite&mdash;among Piedmont crystalline rocks along the Piney River in Amherst County&mdash;used
in the ceramic and glass industry&mdash;Virginia ranks first in quantity and in value</p>

<p>Bauxite&mdash;in Augusta County&mdash;used for manufacturing aluminum, chemicals and
abrasives</p>

<p>Gypsum&mdash;in Smyth and Washington Counties&mdash;used primarily for the manufacture

<p>Titanium concentrates&mdash;in Nelson, Hanover and Amherst Counties&mdash;these minerals
consist of ilmenite (used chiefly in the manufacture of pigments and to a slight
extent in making steel) and rutile (used mainly for coating on electrical welding
rods); titanium is used for increasing the hardness, strength and durability of steel and
is sometimes used in making pottery, china and stainless steel&mdash;Virginia ranks third
in titanium concentrates</p></blockquote>

<p>Sand and gravel, used primarily for roadbuilding and general construction
projects, rank fourth in value. Most of the sand and gravel is located along the
Coastal Plain, especially in Henrico, Chesterfield, Prince George and Princess
Anne Counties. Sand and gravel are also used for "fill," for engine sands, railroad
ballast and glass. Clay (excluding that type used in the manufacture of pottery)
ranks fifth in financial value. Clay deposits are widespread throughout Virginia&mdash;especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in Botetourt, Buckingham, Chesterfield, Henrico and Prince William
Counties&mdash;and vary from red to light-colored to white. They are used chiefly for
brick and tile construction.</p>

<p>With respect to metals, Virginia mines the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Barite&mdash;widespread deposits&mdash;used in the preparation of oil well drilling, muds, chemicals</p>

<p>Diatomite&mdash;Tidewater section&mdash;an earthy material used as an insulator, as a filter
medium for oils, in sugar refining</p>

<p>Feldspar&mdash;widespread deposits&mdash;chiefly in Amelia, Bedford and Prince Edward Counties&mdash;used
chiefly in the ceramics industry for making pottery and in the manufacture
of glass, enamelware, enamel brick, and as an abrasive in soaps and cleansers</p>

<p>Gold&mdash;northeast Piedmont and Blue Ridge Plateau&mdash;little gold at present but the best
developed gold deposits are located in Fauquier, Buckingham, Culpeper, Goochland,

in the manufacture of paint, in storage batteries, cable covering and as an alloy;
zinc: in Scott, Wythe, Rockingham and Spotsylvania Counties&mdash;used for producing
metallic zinc, for galvanizing and (when alloyed with copper) for making brass</p>

<p>Mica&mdash;among the crystalline rocks of the Piedmont Provinces&mdash;white mica called muscovite
is used chiefly for electric insulation, for coating wallpaper, for roofing paper,
in lubricants and in heat-resistant windows; sheet mica is used in electronic equipment&mdash;in
Amelia, Bedford, and Henrico Counties</p>

<p>Natural gas&mdash;in Buchanan and Dickenson Counties&mdash;used for fuel and power</p>

<p>Pyrite&mdash;widespread deposits, particularly in Carroll County&mdash;used for its sulphur content

<p>Tungsten&mdash;in Mecklenburg County&mdash;used for making high-speed tool steel and munitions</p>

<p>Wool-rock&mdash;in the Valley of Virginia and the Ridge provinces&mdash;used for the manufacture
of rock wool for heat and sound insulation</p></blockquote>

<p>As civilization progresses and new inventions are created, the demand for
natural resources will increase. As new processing methods are devised, Virginia
will undoubtedly increase the development of such resources.</p>


<h3><em>Human Resources</em></h3>

<p>The natural resources of a state assume a comparatively minor role unless there
are human resources to develop and to utilize them. The present population of
Virginia is approximately 3,900,000 people. This figure represents a gain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
approximately 17% in the last decade. Virginia now ranks sixteenth in population
among the fifty states of the United States. Of this total population, approximately
40% in 1960 lived in incorporated localities having a population of 25,000
or more, an increase of approximately 4% over 1950; approximately 78% are
white and 22% are non-white. Of the non-white population, approximately 21%
are Negroes and the remainder consists primarily of Indians, Chinese and Japanese.
Most of the survivors of the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Indians now live
on reservations in King William County and the Chickahominy Indians in New
Kent and Charles City Counties. Of the white population in Virginia, only
1.03% is foreign-born.</p>

<p>Density of population refers to the average number of people per square mile
in a state. Density is found by dividing the total population of a state by the
total land area of the state. The density of population in 1960 was 96. The
counties of Fairfax (southwest of, and adjacent to, Arlington County) and of
Henrico (adjacent to Richmond) more than doubled their population from 1950
to 1960.</p>

<p>From 1880 to 1930, while the population was increasing rapidly in most states
of the United States, it was increasing very slowly in Virginia&mdash;only a 5% increase.
During this period, there was a large migration from Virginia to other
regions of the United States, primarily to seek better employment opportunities.
Of this emigration, 65% consisted of non-whites. This emigration practically
ceased during the 1930's. During the Great Depression, agricultural workers who
had made up the large proportion of the previous emigration realized the futility
of migrating to urban areas beyond the state, already overcrowded with unemployed
people. Although manufacturing activities in the nation declined during
this period, in Virginia such activities increased, causing the number of employees
in manufacturing to increase in Virginia. At the same time, governmental activities
within Virginia and in areas adjacent to Virginia greatly expanded, thus
affording more opportunities for additional employment in Virginia than in many
other states of the Union during this time.</p>

<p>In the 1940's Virginia had a percentage rate of population growth of 23.9%,
the highest percentage rate since the first census of 1790. This growth was partly
a result of a high birth rate, a low death rate and the greatest net immigration of
people in Virginia's history since the colonial period. Approximately 216,900
persons became residents of Virginia during this decade. At the same time,
there was a high rate of development of employment opportunities in Virginia as
manufacturing, mining, tourist trade, wholesale and retail trades and service
industries expanded rapidly. The chief factor, however, in the immigration increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
was the widespread increase of federal government employment, civilian and
military.</p>

<p>The total population of the state increased by 18% during the decade 1950-1960.
However, during the same decade, Virginia changed in population rank
from the fifteenth place among the forty-eight states to the sixteenth place among
the fifty states. The ten most populated cities in Virginia are Norfolk, Richmond,
Newport News, Portsmouth, Roanoke, Alexandria, Hampton, Lynchburg, Danville
and Petersburg. During the past decade, the population of three cities has
been materially increased through annexation. In 1952, Hampton, Phoebus and
Elizabeth City County consolidated into the first class city of Hampton. In the
same year, Warwick County became a city also. In 1955, Norfolk became the
largest city in population in the state when it annexed the Tanners Creek Magisterial
District of Norfolk County. In 1958, the cities of Warwick and Newport
News were officially consolidated into the one large city of Newport News which
now ranks third in population.</p>


<h3><em class="gesperrt">SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>Since Virginia borders the Atlantic Ocean and is located almost halfway
between the northern and southern boundaries of the United States, it has a
very favorable geographical location. An abundance of mountain and plain areas,
rivers and lakes, a moderate climate and the presence of varying altitudes from
sea level to 5,719 feet furnishes Virginia with five distinct topographical regions
and much scenic beauty. Several unique geographical features found in Virginia
such as Burning Spring, Natural Bridge, Natural Tunnel, Crabtree Falls, Natural
Chimneys, several caverns and the nine state parks, in addition to the well-known
Shenandoah National Park, help to make Virginia a most desirable tourist
area. A variety of natural resources such as soil, forests, fish, waterpower, coal,
miscellaneous minerals and metals promote numerous occupations within the
boundaries of Virginia. Ranking thirty-sixth in area and sixteenth in population
among the states of the United States, Virginia has an attractive environmental
location with a large diversity of skills among its inhabitants. Thus, Virginia is
well-endowed geographically and has many potential resources for future progress.</p>

Historical Life: 1584-1775</h2>

<h3><em>Exploration and Colonization</em></h3>


<p>Through the efforts of John Cabot who explored the coast of North
America in 1497, according to a patent granted to him by King Henry VII,
England had a substantial claim to New World territory. Attempts at founding
an English colony in America, however, were not made until 1583 when Sir
Humphrey Gilbert received permission from Queen Elizabeth to settle a colony
in the area now known as Newfoundland. This attempt was unsuccessful and
Sir Humphrey Gilbert and his colleagues drowned during a storm at sea on their
return voyage. Nevertheless, Gilbert had selected a site for a colony and had
claimed the island for England. The proprietary patent which Gilbert had received
from Queen Elizabeth was renewed and passed to his half-brother, Sir Walter
Raleigh.</p>

<p>In 1584, the name "Virginia" was given to the area of land claimed by John
Cabot, an area extending from Roanoke Island 600 miles in an arc formation.
Some historians state that Raleigh himself named the area "Virginia" in honor
of Queen Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen, while others indicate that Queen Elizabeth
herself named it in her own honor. From 1584 to 1591, Raleigh made
numerous attempts with the use of his personal fortune to establish an English
colony on Roanoke Island&mdash;located off what is now known as the North Carolina
coast&mdash;but his efforts were futile and the so-called "Lost Colony" resulted. In
1587, after Raleigh's second group of colonists had arrived at Roanoke Island
(the first group having returned to England after unsurmountable difficulties had
beset them), they established a settlement there. This was the settlement where
the first child of English parents was born in America. Her name was Virginia
Dare (named in honor of her birthplace) and she was the granddaughter of John
White, Governor of the settlement. When the colonists' provisions became low,
Governor White returned to England for additional ones. Four years passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
before he returned to the settlement because of the War between England and
Spain, and upon his return, he found no settlers on the island. Various areas and
locations were searched in vain and only one possible clue was ever found: the
letters, "CROATAN," carved on a tree. These letters spelled the name of an
island which had been inhabited by friendly Indians of the same name. Thus, the
"Lost Colony" remains an historical mystery which has never been solved.</p>

<p>The many sincere efforts on the part of Sir Walter Raleigh plus the vast sums
of money which he spent for these colonization attempts convinced the English
people that colonization was too complicated an activity for individuals to pursue
alone. Since the English government did not desire to undertake these settlement
projects, charters were issued by King James I to stock and joint-stock companies.
Under this system, each stockholder bought a certain number of shares. If the
company succeeded, each stockholder earned a profit based upon the number of
shares he owned. On April 10, 1606, the Virginia Charter was granted under
which two companies were incorporated: the London Company consisting mainly
of men from London and the Plymouth Company consisting mainly of men from
Plymouth and neighboring towns. The charter granted them the right to settle
in the area in that part of the American coast known as "Virginia" between 30
and 45 degrees north latitude and as far inland as 100 miles. The London Company
was granted for settlement the coast between 34 and 41 degrees north latitude
and fifty miles north and south of the point of settlement; the Plymouth Company
was granted the coast between 38 and 45 degrees north. The overlapping area
between 38 and 41 degrees could be settled by either company as long as the
company did not colonize within 100 miles of a settlement established by the
other. The charter also guaranteed the colonists and their descendants all rights,
privileges and franchises enjoyed by Englishmen living in England at this time.</p>

<p>The government of the colony established by the Virginia Charter was to
consist of a Superior Council of thirteen members in England and a Resident or
Inferior Council in the colony itself, with complete administrative powers and
political control reserved for the King. Each landholder was required to pay an
annual quitrent to the Crown and was forbidden to carry on trade with any
foreign country without a license. Before the charter was signed, in order to
encourage a large number of stockholders, the London Company agreed to make
each subscriber to its stock who paid twelve pounds and ten shillings the "lord of
200 acres of land" which would be owned by "him and his heirs forever." Consequently,
the company raised sufficient money to finance a colonizing expedition,
and, shortly after the charter had been signed officially by the King, the company
sent its first emigrants on the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The settlements of the Plymouth Company were unsuccessful. The London
Company had six hundred fifty-nine members, many of whom were knights,
aristocrats and gentlemen of learning as well as the usual merchant and middle
class citizens. In general, there were two groups of stockholders: the adventurers
who purchased the stock but remained in England, and the planters who personally
established the colony and then lived in it. Although the company was
primarily organized for profit making, it was also expected to help the mother
country, England, by supplying her with products which she herself could not
produce. Some of the colonists sincerely desired to acquaint and convert the
Indians to Christianity. The leader of the London Company organization was
Bartholomew Gosnold and his chief associates were Edward Maria Wingfield,
a rich merchant, Robert Hunt, a clergyman, George Percy, a poet and scholar,
and John Smith, a versatile individual.</p>

<p>On December 6, 1606, the London Company dispatched three ships from
Blackwell, London, England: the Sarah Constant (or Susan Constant), captained
by Sir Christopher Newport, the Admiral of the fleet; the Goodspeed (or Godspeed),
captained by Bartholomew Gosnold; and the Discovery (or Discoverer),
captained by John Ratcliffe. These ships carried one hundred twenty passengers,
men and boys, only sixteen of whom died on the long journey to Virginia. This
is a very small number lost when one considers the size and type of ships used,
the extremely long voyage which lasted approximately four months, over the
Atlantic Ocean at its greatest width, the lack of proper food and drinking water
and the severe storm which the fleet encountered off the Florida coast. This storm
blew them off their intended course to two capes which appeared guarding a
huge bay. The settlers sighted these capes on Sunday, May 6, 1607 and named
them Cape Henry for Henry, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I, and Cape
Charles for Charles, the Duke of York, another son of James I. The bay was
Chesapeake Bay, so-named by the Indians. They sailed up a river tributary, called
Powhatan by the Indians, to the bay and then to a peninsula located about fifty
miles above its mouth. This site is believed to have been chosen because the water
was deep enough to allow the ships to dock close to the shore and because a
peninsula could be comparatively easily defended against Indian attacks. Here
the settlers landed on May 24, 1607 and established the first permanent English
settlement in America. They called the settlement Jamestown in honor of their
King, James I, and called the river on which they had traveled the James River.
There, the minister, Parson Robert Hunt, standing under a ship's canvas sail
stretched between four trees, led a thanksgiving service to God on behalf of all
the passengers for their safe arrival in America. He also had the privilege of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
celebrating the first Holy Communion in America. Thus, the settlement of Jamestown
became the "Cradle of the Republic" because it was the birthplace of the
area now known as the United States as well as of the State of Virginia.</p>

<p>The colonists had been given sealed written instructions concerning their local
governmental leaders, and these instructions were not to be opened until the ships
reached Virginia. The council members had no power to make laws but were
appointed to see that the laws approved by the King were enforced. Since John
Smith had shown strong leadership qualities, had frequently criticized the management
of the ships, and had exerted much influence on the voyage to America,
he had aroused jealousy on the part of some of the other voyagers. As a result,
the accusation was made that he was desirous of becoming the King of Virginia.
Fearing that he might assume too much political power, his cohorts arrested him
upon the pretense of treason and mutiny and imprisoned him on shipboard until
the end of the journey. When the unsealed instructions were read, the first Resident
Council consisted of Bartholomew Gosnold, George Kendall, John Martin,
Christopher Newport, John Ratcliffe, John Smith and Edward Maria Wingfield,
president of the first council. John Smith was later charged with sedition, acquitted,
and finally restored to his rightful council position.</p>

<p>In addition to naming the members of the Resident Council, the written instructions
for the colonists provided that all the colonists should work for a
"common store." This rule resulted in a great hardship because some of the
physically able and capable colonists left the tasks of planting, building, and
performing of additional necessary duties to others. Some of the colonists were
gentlemen by profession, unaccustomed to hard physical labor, and interested
mostly in finding gold or attaining a quick fortune and then returning to England.
A majority of the colonists, however, worked hard and, after building a fort for
protection, continued to construct a storehouse, a church and log huts for residences.
The morale of the colonists became very low when the food supplies
became scanty; diseases of fever and dysentery appeared due to the humid, marshy,
mosquito-laden land area; and Indian attacks became common. With arrows
tipped with deer's horn and with sharp stones, the Indians had shot at the colonists,
severely injuring Captain Gabriel Archer and one of the sailors. However,
the first large organized Indian attack occurred in the latter part of May when two
hundred Indians attacked the settlers. They were finally driven back through the
efforts of the colonists under the leadership of Captain Edward Maria Wingfield.</p>

<p>Captain John Smith, Captain Christopher Newport and twenty other settlers
decided to explore the general area of the Jamestown region. From June to
September, they journeyed the entire length of the Chesapeake Bay and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
witnessed the eastern shore of the bay, the Potomac River, the Great Falls, the
Susquehanna River, the Rappahannock River, the York River and the Chesapeake
River. Smith carefully drew a map of the entire area and called it a "Map
of the Chesapeake." He sent it to England via Captain Newport, and it was later
published in London.</p>

<p>The courage and persistent hard work of the settlers and the leadership of
Captain John Smith were invaluable. Captain John Smith maintained harmony
in the Council, encouraged friendly relations with the Indians (eventually to the
extent of getting corn, an absolute necessity, from them) and changed the
"common store" policy to a "no work-no eat" policy which had most effective
results on the indolent settlers. In 1608, he wrote a fascinating narration about
the founding of the Virginia Colony which he entitled "A True Relation." He
is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Virginia" because of his participation
in so many activities: a governmental official (president of the Council from
September 1608 to September 1609), a diplomat in his relations with the Indians,
a leader in attempting to maintain peaceful, cooperative relations among the
settlers themselves, an observing prisoner of the Indians (during which time he
learned much of their culture and experienced the miraculous saving of his life
by the Indian girl, Pocahontas) and a writer who tried to picture the happenings
of the settlers in an enjoyable fashion.</p>

<p>In addition to saving Smith's life, Pocahontas helped the Virginia settlers by
having corn and venison brought to them and, later, by warning John Smith of
a proposed Indian attack. After John Smith returned to England, Pocahontas
stopped visiting the colony, and the Indians soon refused to bring any more corn
to the colonists. Pocahontas was eventually captured by a Jamestown settler,
Captain Samuel Argall, through the trickery of an Indian who betrayed her in
return for a "copper Kettle and some trinkets." She was held as a hostage in
Jamestown in an effort to restore peace between the Indians and the English.
This strategy was so successful that friendly relations were re-established. Two
years later, in April, 1614, Pocahontas married John Rolfe, an English gentleman,
at the Jamestown Church. Pocahontas had met and had become well acquainted
with John Rolfe during her captivity at Jamestown. She had been baptized at
the Jamestown Church and had been given the name of Rebecca. They lived for
a while at Jamestown and then at Varina, Rolfe's plantation. Three years after
their marriage, Rebecca and John and their baby, Thomas, age one, traveled to
England, accompanied by approximately a dozen Indians who desired to be educated
in England. Rebecca was received royally at the court, and she was so
well-mannered and charming that this lady who had grown up in the wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of Virginia was readily accepted by London Society. When Captain John Smith
heard of her arrival in England, he informed Queen Anne of the great help furnished
to the Virginia Colony by this Indian maiden during her youth. Pocahontas
then became Lady Rebecca and remained in England for over a year. As
they were getting ready to return to Virginia, Lady Rebecca died suddenly and
was buried in St. George's Church at Gravesend, England. Today, two beautiful
stained-glass windows may be seen in this church, a gift of the Colonial Dames
of Virginia, as a token of gratitude for services rendered to the Colony of Virginia
by Princess Pocahontas.</p>

<p>John Ratcliffe and Captain John Smith succeeded to the presidency of the
council after Captain Wingfield. While Smith was president of the council,
King James I granted another charter for Virginia in 1609 upon the reorganization
of the London Company. This charter provided that: (1) the area of Virginia
was henceforth to include all the land on its eastern coast 200 miles north and
200 miles south of Old Point Comfort and extending from the Atlantic Ocean
west and northwest to the Pacific Ocean; therefore, Virginia included at this time
land now found in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, West
Virginia, Kentucky, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota; (2) a Resident Council
was to be established which would have the power to distribute land, make all
laws and appoint all officers for Virginia's government; membership in the council
was to result from election by the members of the company in England, a majority
vote being required for the election; and (3) the colonists were to take the Oath
of Supremacy making the Church of England the only recognized church of the
colony.</p>

<p>In the same year, Captain John Smith bought a tract of land located near
Richmond from the Indian Chief, Powhatan, and there he founded a settlement
which he called "None Such." He named it thus because he believed there was
"none such" site as scenically beautiful anywhere. This site was formerly Emperor
Powhatan's summer court location.</p>

<p>In the same year also Thomas West, Lord de la Warr (Delaware), became the
"Lord Governor and Captaine Generall" of the Virginia colony. Although he held
this office until June 1618, he remained in England during this time because of
ill health with the exception of the period June 1610-March 1611. In May 1610,
Sir Thomas Gates, the first Governor of the colony of Virginia, arrived at Jamestown.
Captain George Percy had succeeded Captain Smith as president of the
Council. Starvation from a lack of food supplies followed, and the population
of the colony was reduced from 500 to 60 people. These sixty were approximately
fourteen miles away from Jamestown on their way back to England when some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of Lord de la Warr's ships arrived bringing food and fifty additional settlers.
Lord de la Warr was responsible also for having a trading post established at
Hampton. Today, Hampton is the oldest continuous Anglo-Saxon settlement
still in existence in the United States.</p>

<p>A short time later, Sir Thomas Dale (better known as "Marshall") arrived from
England as Governor of the colony. He was considered a harsh Governor because
his martial law administration was characterized by severe punishment for wrongdoing.
However, he was responsible for having common property divided among
the colonists and for allowing them to own their shares privately. He ordered that
three acres of land be given to every man. In return for this land, the owner was
required to give six bushels of corn each year to the colony. The owner then was
allowed to keep the rest of his crops, two acres of which had to be planted in corn
before any tobacco could be raised. This action was the first official recognition of
the right of owning property in America and such action resulted in much more
industrious efforts put forth on the part of the new owners.</p>

<p>In 1611, Sir Thomas Dale founded the third settlement in Virginia: Henricopolis
or the City of Henricus (named for the eldest son of King James I, Prince
Henry). Approximately 350 settlers, mostly German laborers, soon colonized
there. Two years later, Governor Dale was also responsible for a settlement being
established at the site of the junction of the Appomattox and James Rivers. It
was called New Bermuda or Bermuda Hundred because of its similarity to the
British Island of Bermuda. For many years this settlement served as a convenient
shipping point and the present city of Hopewell is an outgrowth of this early site.</p>

<p>In 1612, a third charter was granted by King James I for the Virginia Colony.
This was a most liberal charter as it abolished the Superior Council and gave full
governing powers of the colony directly to the London Company members, thus
making the company a self-governing corporation. The name was changed from
the London Company to the Virginia Company. The company was to hold four
meetings each year in London, and these meetings were called meetings of the
General Court or "Quarter Courts." At such meetings, the officers were to be
elected by the stockholders and the laws of the colony were to be passed. The
General Court also had the power to manage the business of the company and to
appoint the Governor and councillors for the Virginia colony. The charter extended
the eastern seaboard boundary to include the Bermudas and, in addition, gave the
company the authority to hold lotteries for its own benefit.</p>

<p>In the same year, John Rolfe began experimenting at Varina, his plantation,
with some tobacco seeds brought from the West Indies or from South America.
Pocahontas helped Rolfe in this task by teaching him the necessity of keeping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
young, tender leaves protected from the cold and by showing him how gently the
young tobacco plants must be transplanted. Rolfe became the first white man to
raise tobacco successfully in Virginia. Then the problem of curing tobacco in such
a manner that it could reach England without spoilage faced him. After some
experimentation, his shipment was the first one to reach England in good condition.
As a result, tobacco became the first important money crop and export
of Virginia. In addition to the price the planters received for this product, the
production of tobacco created employment for merchants and shippers. After
Rolfe's success in growing and curing tobacco, it was grown by practically everyone
in a variety of places: fields, gardens, between graves and, in some instances,
in the streets of Jamestown. Prosperous times had finally arrived at Jamestown.
When the Englishmen at home realized the profit and excellent opportunities
available in tobacco growing, many journeyed to Virginia and began tobacco
raising. Previously, the settlers' occupations had consisted primarily of farming
(especially the cultivation of grapes) and of the manufacture of potash, soap,
glass and tar. The successful growing of tobacco caused a tremendous increase in
the population of the colony and in the amount of tobacco shipped from Virginia.
This infant tobacco production was the background for the present day high rank
of Virginia in tobacco production.</p>

<p>In 1616, the company allowed each settler to have 100 acres of land for his
personal use. A few years later, a 50-acre tract of land was awarded to each
settler who paid his own fare to America and an additional 50 acres for every
pioneer he brought with him. This land arrangement, called the "Head-Right"
system, formed the basis of the Virginia land system. This system resulted in the
creation of large estates, and in the 1650's the average size land grant in Virginia
was approximately 500 acres. Such areas were commonly called plantations, and
the owners of such plantations, known as Virginia planters, ultimately became the
dominant influence in the Virginia government. Some of these early plantation
owners were William Byrd, Thomas Warren, William Fitzhugh and Abraham
Wood.</p>

<p>After the Virginia Company had been given full governmental control of its
colony, there were some members in the General Court who believed that Virginia
settlers themselves should be given more freedom. When these liberal-minded
individuals gained control of the company, their leader, Sir Edwin Sandys, was
responsible for obtaining ratification of "The Great Charter of Privileges, Orders
and Laws" by the General Court on November 28, 1618. In 1619, Sir Edwin
Sandys was elected head of the company and he immediately sent Sir George
Yeardley as Governor to Virginia to put the charter into effect in order that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
settlers would enjoy self-government. Because of the sincere efforts put forth
by Sir Edwin Sandys on behalf of this self-government in Virginia, he is often
referred to as the "Father of Representative Government in America."</p>

<p>According to the Great Charter, the Virginia Colony was to be governed by
two councils: one to consist of the Governor and his advisers chosen in England
by the Virginia Company itself and the other council to consist of representatives,
called Burgesses, chosen by the Virginia settlers themselves. Governor Yeardley
carried out his instructions to have the free inhabitants of the Virginia Colony
choose representatives to help him and his advisers in matters concerning taxation
and laws for the welfare of the settlers. The settlements were organized into four
"incorporations" or "parishes" with Jamestown, the titular capital city of the
colony: City of Henricus, Charles City, James City and Kiccowtan (later called
Elizabeth City). These parishes were then further divided into eleven districts
called boroughs, hundreds or plantations. Each of these districts was asked to
elect two Burgesses as representatives in their local government.</p>

<p>Governor Yeardley, therefore, called the first representative legislature in America
to meet in the little church at Jamestown, July 30, 1619. This first General Assembly
of Virginia consisted of the Council, the upper house, and the House of
Burgesses, the lower house. This group was the first popular assembly in the
New World. There was a delay in the initial meeting because the local elections
had to be postponed until after the plowing and sowing of seeds had been done.
The session lasted six days and then adjourned because of the severe heat. The
session began with a prayer by the minister and the Governor and Council members
sat in the front pews of the church. John Pory was the presiding officer of
this first General Assembly and he was called the Speaker. Each burgess was
called by name and then given the oath of supremacy in recognition of the sovereignty
of King James I. After the oath had been taken, he officially entered the
Assembly. Two burgesses were refused membership in the Assembly due to an
unusual land patent condition. One of these prospective burgesses had been
legally excused from obeying colonial laws by his land grant terms. The action of
refusal was significant because it created the precedent that the Virginia Assembly
has the right to decide the qualifications of its own members and to expel members
even if they have been sworn in and admitted to the Assembly if conditions
so warrant.</p>

<p>Although the session was very brief, much was accomplished, including the
acceptance of the charter by the General Assembly members. Since this charter
was the foundation of the laws used by the General Assembly to rule the Virginia
Colony, it was called a constitution and was the first written constitution promulgated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in our country. Other petitions presented at this time are indications of
the trend of thought of these political leaders: former grants of land should be
confirmed and new grants made to the early settlers, shares of land should be
given to all male children born in Virginia, rents of the ministers' lands should
be made payable in commodities instead of money, a sub-treasurer should be
appointed to live in the colony, and men should be sent to build a college in the
colony. Other laws passed by the Assembly itself concerned the punishment of
idlers, gamblers and drunkards, the payment of church dues, the religious duty of
the colonists, the regulation of trade, the relations of whites to Indians, the regulation
of the duties of ministers and the conduct of servants. The Assembly also
levied a tax of one pound of tobacco on every male inhabitant over sixteen years
of age, the tax to be used for the payment of services of its officers (speaker, clerk,
sergeant and provost marshal of James City). The Governor then adjourned the
Assembly until March 1, 1620.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular settlers at Jamestown, from time to time indentured
servants came to America. They were individuals who signed contracts called
"indentures" whereby they agreed to work as apprentices or tenant farmers for a
stated time in return for their paid passage to America. On August 30, 1619, a
ship that looked like a Dutch man-of-war but actually was believed to be a pirate
craft came to Jamestown with a cargo of twenty Negroes which it sold to the
Governor and the colonists. This was the first recorded selling of slaves in the area
now called the United States. The Negroes seemed to be more easily adaptable
to hard, manual labor than the Indians or indentured white servants had been.
The need for labor which could endure the intense sun of the tobacco fields made
the Negroes much more desirable than the whites since they seemed to endure
these conditions more satisfactorily.</p>

<p>During the same year, another historical milestone occurred in Virginia when
a ship arrived at Jamestown with sixty young women from England. Each bachelor
who desired a bride had to pay 120 pounds of tobacco for his bride's passage.
The young women stayed at the married planters' homes until their marriage.
These brave women made happy homes and helped shoulder the responsibilities
so that community life in Virginia became more settled. They wrote such cheerful,
courageous accounts of their life in Virginia that a second shipload soon followed
and more homes were rapidly established.</p>

<p>In July 1621, the London Company issued to Virginia a code of written laws
and a frame of government patterned after the English type: the Governor of
the colony was to be appointed by the company, a Council was to be appointed
by the company, and a House of Burgesses was to be elected by the colonists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
themselves. Whenever making laws, the councilors and burgesses were to sit
together. A law would be proposed, debated and, if passed, be submitted to the
Governor for his approval. The company in England would have the final ratification
or rejection. The right of petition and the right of trial by jury were guaranteed.
A unique feature was the provision that the burgesses had the power of
vetoing any objectionable acts of the company. Thus, additional political rights
were furnished to the colonists by this so-called Virginia Constitution of 1621.</p>

<p>At noon on March 22, 1622, the "Great Massacre" occurred. Complete annihilation
of all the Jamestown inhabitants by the Powhatan Indian Confederacy
was prevented primarily by the warning of an Indian convert, a boy named
Chanco. The settlement of Henricopolis (now called Dutch Gap) was completely
destroyed: 347 men, women and children&mdash;approximately one-third of
the total population of the colony&mdash;were slain at this time under the strategy of
Opechancanough, the leader of the Indians. An ironic happening of the Great
Massacre was that one of the victims was George Thorpe, superintendent of the
planned college and university of colonial Virginia. He had been a member of
Parliament who had sold his estate in England and had come to Virginia to spend
his personal fortune and the rest of his life for the conversion and the education
of the Indians. By 1619 the General Assembly had set apart 10,000 acres of land
for the construction and support of a college for educating Indian youth in "true
religion, moral virtue, and civility." The College of Henrico, the first formal
educational institution of higher learning in the English colonies, was also destroyed
during this Indian Massacre. So strong was the vengeance of the British
upon the Indians that no more serious trouble with the Indians occurred until
1644.</p>

<p>Some influential people in England who did not approve of a British colony
in America tried to encourage the King to abolish the Virginia Company's charter.
The Great Massacre gave King James I the opportunity he sought, and, since the
company had been unable to pay its dividends, he finally annulled the company's
charter on May 24, 1624. Virginia thus became the first royal or crown colony in
England's history. The greatest change under the new governmental setup was
that now the King, rather than the Virginia Company, appointed the Governor
and the councilors, thus making the Governor a royal Governor rather than a
company official. King James I died the following year and his son, Charles I,
succeeded to the throne. Two years later, the King authorized the General Assembly
to meet, primarily in order that he could obtain the excellent monopoly of the
Virginia tobacco trade. Much to his surprise, the colonists refused to grant him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
such monopoly, and, as a result, he did not authorize another meeting for twelve
years.</p>

<p>From 1629 through 1632, two more provinces were carved from Virginia by
royal grants: the Province of Carolina to Sir Robert Heath and the Province of
Maryland to Lord Baltimore. The Virginians had not protested much against
the grant to Sir Robert Heath, but they did protest strongly against the grant to
Lord Baltimore. The leader of this protest was William Claiborne who had previously
organized a colony and a trading post on part of the Maryland grant area.</p>

<p>In 1634, the Virginia Colony was politically reorganized from four parishes
to eight shires or counties: Accawmack (an Indian name meaning "the-across-the-water-place";
the name was later changed to Northampton, an English county
name and the two present counties of Accomack and Northampton occupy the
same original site), Charles City (named for King Charles), Charles River
(changed to York in 1642-43 in honor of the Duke of York), Elizabeth City
(formerly Kiccotan&mdash;named for Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King James),
James City (named for King James), Henrico (named for Prince Henry, son of
King James), Warrosquyoake (changed to Isle of Wight in 1637&mdash;some of the
early patentees had come from the Isle of Wight in the English Channel: the
word, "wight," means a passage or channel; therefore, it means "island of the
channel"), and Warwick River (changed to Warwick in 1642-1643, named after
the Earl of Warwick who was a prominent Virginia Company member). These
counties were the second oldest unit of local government in the United States,
the New England town being the first. The long distances between plantations
and the difficult transportation facilities on land and on the rivers discouraged the
use of the New England Town Meeting type of local government in the Virginia
Colony. The counties themselves were patterned after the English counties. At
this same time, suffrage was extended to all free male citizens for electing members
of the House of Burgesses and county officials.</p>

<p>On February 12, 1634, Benjamin Syms of Elizabeth City County gave 200
acres of land plus 8 cows for the establishment of a free school for white children.
This was the first legacy for the promotion of public school education, and Elizabeth
City County was the birthplace of the Virginia public school system.</p>

<p>In 1642 Sir William Berkeley arrived in Virginia as a royal Governor. Until
this time, there had been much religious tolerance in the Virginia Colony although
the Church of England was the Established Church of the Colony. The religious
laws were liberal, and other religions had existed without interference. Sir Edwin
Sandys had encouraged some Separatists (Puritans) to live in Virginia, and by the
time of the dissolution of the Virginia Company charter, thirteen parishes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
been created and many clergymen had been active in the colony. Governor
Berkeley was an extremely strong defender of the King and of the Church of
England and disliked the Quakers and the Puritans very much. He was directly
responsible for driving most of them from the Virginia Colony by enforcing a
statute of 1643 which provided that no individual who disbelieved the doctrines
of the English Church could teach, publicly or privately, or preach the gospel
within the limits of Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1644 another Indian massacre occurred resulting in the death of 300-500
Virginians. This massacre was led by the aged, famous Indian leader, Opechancanough.
It took place on Holy Thursday and the Puritans believed that this was
a direct act of God as punishment for their previous treatment in Virginia. The
settlers finally dispersed the Indians, destroyed their villages and destroyed the
Powhatan Confederacy which had consisted of approximately fifty tribes. Opechancanough
was later shot and killed.</p>

<p>In the following year, the General Assembly allowed the election of vestries
by the qualified voters of each parish regardless of their religious faith. As counties
were organized in Virginia, parishes likewise were established and vestries
continued to be elected by the qualified voters. The vestry was the governing
body of the parish, and although its membership number varied between the
parishes, the number was finally fixed at twelve. They were self-perpetuating,
and could only be removed by the General Assembly. They had the power to
select a rector as well as to carry on regular parish duties. Under this arrangement,
the Established Church was part of the county government with the officers
of a parish having civil as well as religious duties and authority. Some of
the civil duties included levying tax rates on parish inhabitants to raise revenue
for carrying out their objectives, maintaining roads to and from the church, keeping
the vital statistics (records of births, marriages, deaths, et cetera) and aiding
the poor.</p>

<p>During this period, the British Parliament began feuding with King Charles.
The Virginians strongly favored the King, and after he was beheaded, the General
Assembly passed a law recognizing Charles II, the former King's exiled son, as the
lawful King of England. In return for their loyal support upon behalf of his
father and himself, Charles II bestowed the title of "The Old Dominion" on the
Virginia Colony, the only American colony ever to receive such an honor. Parliament
tried to combat this loyalty to the King by appointing two Virginians,
William Claiborne and Richard Bennett, as commissioners whose duty was to
influence Virginia and gradually bring it under Parliamentary control. Parliament
then provided them with an armed force. Governor Berkeley made military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
preparations also, but negotiations finally ended in a peaceful settlement without
resorting to open hostilities in Virginia. Individuals who had favored the King
during the Civil War in England between the Parliament and the King were
called Cavaliers. Since Virginia had remained loyal to the King throughout this
period, many Cavaliers had sought refuge in Virginia at this time. This action
caused the Virginia Colony to receive the nickname of the "Cavalier State."</p>

<p>In 1650, Mary, Margaret and Giles Brent erected homes on Aquia Creek,
Virginia. They were the first English Catholic inhabitants of Virginia. In this
same area, twenty-six years later, the first English-speaking Catholic colony of
Virginia was settled. In 1677, a Catholic Church was erected here. After their
nephew, George Brent, and others had been successful in obtaining a Proclamation
from James II guaranteeing religious freedom on the 30,000 acres of the
Brenton Tract, many settlers came to this area. Today, a large bronze Crucifix
can be seen near the highway in Stafford County as a reminder of the religious
efforts of the Brent Family.</p>


<h3><em>The Commonwealth and the "Golden Age"</em></h3>

<p>The Virginia Colony finally received a charter of self-government during Oliver
Cromwell's rule in England and became the Commonwealth of Virginia on
March 12, 1651. The Treaty of Jamestown provided that Virginians would be
guaranteed the freedoms and privileges of the English people in return for a
recognition of the Puritan Commonwealth of Cromwell in England. The colony
prospered under Governors Richard Bennett, Edward Digges and Samuel Matthews
from 1652-1660. By 1660, the population of the Virginia Colony was
approximately 33,000 or over four times as much as in 1640. Many of this number
consisted of Cavaliers. The population which first had centered around Jamestown,
along the James River to the junction of the James and Appomattox Rivers
and along the navigable inlets, now had broadened into the Tidewater area. As
tobacco production and the use of tobacco increased and as soil fertility became
exhausted, more land was added to the individual farms until large plantations
appeared almost common. Class society in Virginia changed, generally, from a
middle-class one to two distinct classes: the wealthy plantation owner who could
afford such personal workers as slaves and servants and the tenant farmer who
worked for a plantation owner. In return for his services, he was usually allowed
to have a small plot of ground for his own use and a small farm on which to live.
When the Cavaliers, mostly wealthy gentlemen, migrated to Virginia, they
brought added aristocracy to the Virginia Colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, other counties had been formed in Virginia. An area which
had been settled originally in Upper Norfolk was named Nansemond County in
1642. "Nansemond" is an Indian word meaning "fishing point or angle." In
1648, the county of Northumberland was formed from a large Indian district
formerly known as Chickacoan and it was named for Northumberland County,
England. From this large area, one hundred sixteen counties were later formed.
Within a twenty-five year period, seven additional counties were created: Gloucester
County (formed from York and named for the third son of Charles I,
Henry-Duke of Gloucester), New Kent County (formed also from York and
believed to have been named either for the English Kent or for Kent Island),
Lancaster County (from York and Northumberland), Surry (from James City
County), Westmoreland (from Northumberland and later an addition from
James City County), Stafford (from Westmoreland) and Middlesex (from Lancaster)&mdash;the
latter five named in honor of English counties. The formation of
many new counties during this time illustrates the great increase in population
which took place.</p>

<p>When Charles II became King of England in 1660, Britain's colonial policy
changed. Previously, the colonies had been more or less neglected, and interest
in England had been chiefly centered upon religion, intellectual achievement and
local issues. After the Civil War in England, the importance of the colonies
seemed more apparent, competition in setting up and controlling colonial empires
was greater and mercantilism became the key theory accepted by the leading
countries of Europe. Mercantilism was based upon the idea that the colonies
existed for the benefit of the mother country and that they had specific obligations
or responsibilities to fulfill, namely: (1) to produce the articles which the mother
country needs and which are impossible for the mother country to produce; (2)
to supply the mother country with foodstuffs which she needs, (3) to furnish a
market for the mother country's manufactured goods, and (4) to export colonial
goods in mother country ships only. Earlier in 1651, Parliament had passed a
law prohibiting foreign vessels from trading with the American colonists. This
law had been aimed primarily at the Dutch. It also stated that all products sent
by the American colonies to England or sent from one colony to another had to
be carried in either English or American ships. However, there had not been
strict enforcement of this law in Virginia.</p>

<p>The Navigation Acts of 1660 and 1663 were passed providing that goods imported
into the colonies had to be carried by English, Irish or American ships. The
act further stated that certain "enumerated articles" or exports could be sent only
to the British Isles or to the English possessions: for example, tobacco, sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
apples, wool, indigo and dyewood. The list was increased as time passed, and the
ill feeling of the Virginia Colony as well as the other English colonies in America
toward the mother country can be fully understood, especially since higher prices
for their articles could be obtained from foreign countries. The second Navigation
Act required that all European goods destined for the American colonies be sent
to England and then shipped to America in English ships. Thus, England tried to
maintain a monopoly of her colonial trade. The prosperity of the Virginia Colony
was affected greatly by these acts. Virginia's economy at this time was almost
completely dependent upon its export tobacco trade which was far in excess of
the amount of tobacco which England needed. The Navigation Acts virtually
closed all the markets except England and its possessions to Virginia tobacco.
As a result, the English market was suddenly flooded with Virginia tobacco. There
was much excess tobacco in Virginia itself, some tobacco even rotting on the
farms. The price of tobacco accordingly dropped from fourpence a pound to a
halfpenny per pound by 1667. Virginia, as well as the other American colonies,
at times violated the above regulations and sent some of its goods directly to other
European countries in order to survive these economic blows. Thus, the Restoration
Period which the Virginians had favored had some unexpected results for
them. After the Virginians had urged Sir William Berkeley to resume the governorship
prior to the Restoration, he had gone to England to intercede for the
colonists concerning the tobacco trade and the other Navigation Acts, but his
efforts had been futile.</p>

<p>Another surprise was received by the Virginians at this time. While Charles II
was in exile in France in 1649, he granted more than five million acres of land
lying between the Potomac and the Rappahannock Rivers to four Cavalier friends.
This grant was called the "Northern Neck Proprietary" of Virginia. Twenty years
later, he granted a new charter for the same territory to the surviving grantees.
These actions were unknown to the colonists, and much of this same land had
been settled under patents issued by the Colony itself. When the colonists learned
of the new charter, there was much protest, and some of the colonists tried to buy
out the grantees' interests. However, in most cases, their efforts were in vain.
This grant was later referred to as the Fairfax Proprietary or Fairfax Grant. In
1673, the colonists found out that King Charles II had bestowed the rest of the
Colony as a gift upon the Earl of Arlington and Lord Culpeper for thirty-one
years. This eventually had no lasting ill effects upon the colonists because Lord
Culpeper later purchased the Earl of Arlington's interest and King Charles himself
bought back the entire area from him for a six hundred pounds per year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pension. Lord Fairfax V became the owner in 1689 and the proprietary itself
was abolished by the Virginia General Assembly in 1786.</p>

<p>In 1671, two explorers, Thomas Batts and Robert Fallon, traveled by horseback
from Fort Henry (present Petersburg area) up the Roanoke Valley and across
the Blue Ridge Mountains until they reached the top of the Allegheny Mountains.
They proceeded to the New River and to an area in the present town of
Narrows in Giles County. In order to claim this land for their King, Charles II of
England, they had their Indian guides peel the bark off of four trees and then
burn a symbol&mdash;the initials of King Charles, of Governor William Berkeley and
of Colonel Abraham Wood (who was responsible for this expedition)&mdash;on each
tree with a pair of marking irons. Thus, they took possession of this land and all
the area west of it in the King's name and provided a basic claim of land in
Southwest Virginia.</p>

<p>In this same year, a unique attitude concerning public education was expressed
by royal Governor Berkeley when he stated: "I thank God, there are no free
schools or printing presses and I hope we shall not have them these hundred
years: for learning has brought disobedience and heresy, and sects into the world,
and printing has divulged them, and libels against the best government. God
keep us from both."</p>

<p>In 1672, Parliament passed an act compelling each ship which left the colonies
for Europe to post bond that it would deliver its cargo in England or otherwise
pay the required duty. Colonial customs collectors were to be appointed whose
chief duty was to supervise this trade. An export duty was to be paid on certain
"enumerated" articles&mdash;tobacco, indigo, sugar, apples, dyewood and later, naval
stores, molasses, lumber and hides&mdash;if such articles were sent from one colony
to another. Strict enforcement of this act would have dire results on the Virginia
colonists because their ships had been carrying products from the West Indies and
from Virginia to northern ports and then to Europe. The colonists began to be
extremely dissatisfied with the mother country.</p>

<p>Governor Berkeley at this time was aggravating the home situation of the
Virginia colonists. He had limited suffrage to freeholders and householders only,
had strongly influenced the election of Assembly members to individuals who
were personal friends and who favored the King's policies and had been keeping
the Assembly technically in session for fourteen years without any elections taking
place. The grievance about which the colonists felt the most bitter, however, was
the inadequate protection of the frontier from the Susquehannock Indian attacks.
After these Indians had attacked a plantation owned by Nathaniel Bacon and had
killed his overseer and one of his servants, Bacon decided that the colonists themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
should take organized action against the Indians since the Governor had
practically ignored the attacks. One possible reason for the Governor's hesitancy
in interfering in these Indian affairs was the high profit which he was receiving
from the Indian fur trading. Many of Bacon's neighbors agreed with him, and
they prepared to be the aggressors against the Indians. Bacon asked the Governor
for permission to do so and for a military commission for himself as the leader.
Both requests were refused, and Bacon and his friends were declared rebels by
the Governor. Consequently, Bacon and his followers decided to take matters into
their own hands without the Governor's permission. They proceeded and successfully
defeated the Indians. This action aroused Governor Berkeley who immediately
considered Bacon a traitor, and a civil war or rebellion resulted.</p>

<p>Bacon, in the meantime, had been elected as a member of the House of Burgesses,
and he went to Jamestown to participate in the Assembly. Upon his
arrival, he was arrested, brought to the State House and charged with being a rebel.
Governor Berkeley and the King's Council discussed Bacon's activities, and Bacon
agreed to apologize for his actions if the Governor would grant him his commission.
The Governor agreed, but Bacon felt that the Governor had no intention of carrying
out his promise for a commission. Bacon discussed this meeting with his
neighbor friends who decided to accompany him to Jamestown where he was
to receive his commission. Bacon and approximately four hundred planters
marched to the State House at Jamestown and demanded his commission. When
none was forthcoming, he ordered his men to aim their guns at the windows of
the State House where the House of Burgesses sat. At this drastic move, the
Burgesses quickly prepared the commission paper and persuaded Governor Berkeley
to sign it and then issued it to Bacon. Bacon and his followers then returned
home. Governor Berkeley thereupon decided to fight Bacon and his associates.
Berkeley then departed from Jamestown and crossed the York River to Gloucester
where he called upon his friends to help him. Upon hearing that Bacon was
approaching Gloucester, Berkeley fled across the Chesapeake Bay to Accomack.
In August 1676, Bacon and his followers signed an agreement whereby they
all pledged to fight any and all soldiers that Governor Berkeley might order from
England to the colony. After some Indians living near Richmond made new
attacks upon the settlers there, Bacon and his friends captured the Indian fort and
killed or imprisoned the remaining Indians.</p>

<p>While Bacon was thus engaged, Governor Berkeley with eight hundred soldiers
and eighteen ships in the James River had occupied Jamestown. Bacon proceeded
next to Jamestown and defeated Governor Berkeley's forces there. Governor
Berkeley and many of his soldiers fled to the ships and sailed away. Bacon realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that although he had won on land, he would have no chance of holding out an
attack from the ships. Therefore, he and his friends burned the State House and
the rest of the capital, Jamestown, to prevent Governor Berkeley from repossessing
it. Bacon had become ill with a fever and died shortly afterwards in October at
the home of a friend in Gloucester County. Governor Berkeley had twenty-three
of Bacon's followers put to death, but the principle for which they fought remained
alive: "the people must be heard." Bacon's Rebellion is remembered in
history primarily as a revolt of the plain, common man against a privileged few.
Governor Berkeley was later recalled to England, and, upon his return, instead
of being treated as a hero by the King, he was regarded with contempt.</p>

<p>In 1682, tobacco had been grown so extensively in Virginia that the price of
tobacco on the London market had declined rapidly. When the British government
refused a request from the Virginia colonists to either restrict tobacco acreage
or order a temporary cessation of its growth, tobacco riots occurred in Virginia.
During many nights, thousands of young tobacco plants throughout the colony
were destroyed. Finally, after the execution of six tobacco plant cutters, the riots
ceased. Eventually, the customs duty on tobacco was increased tremendously, and
taxes in Virginia were increased at the same time.</p>

<p>In 1682, John Buckner established the first printing press in Virginia at Jamestown.
His printer was William Nuthead who published several papers and two
sheets of the acts of the Assembly of November 1682, supposedly without a
license. The Colonial Council issued an order prohibiting anything from being
printed until the King had given his permission as there was strong opposition
against "the liberty of a press." Consequently, in December 1683, when King
Charles II prohibited all printing in Virginia, William Nuthead moved his printing
press to St. Mary's City, Maryland.</p>

<p>From 1691 to 1703, seven additional counties were formed in the Virginia
Colony: Norfolk County (created from Lower Norfolk which had become extinct
and named for Norfolk County in England which is also located on the water),
King and Queen County (created from New Kent County and named for the
joint rulers of England: King William III, Prince of Orange, and Queen Mary),
Princess Anne County (created also from Lower Norfolk and named for Princess&mdash;later
Queen&mdash;Anne of England), Essex (created from the then extinct Rappahannock
County and named either for Essex County, England or the Earl of
Essex), Richmond (created also from the then extinct Rappahannock County
and either named for territory resemblance to Richmond, Surry County, England
or in honor of an English Earl or Duke of Richmond), King William County
(created from King and Queen County and named for William of Orange, King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of England), and Prince George County (created from one of the original eight
shires&mdash;Charles City County&mdash;and was named for Prince George of Denmark,
Queen Anne's husband).</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, education in the Virginia Colony was generally
thought of as a family responsibility, not as a community one. Nevertheless, by
1690, some families decided that there should be an educational institution for
higher learning in Virginia in order that their sons would not have to travel
abroad to obtain such an education. A conference was held in Jamestown to
consider the founding of a college in the Virginia Colony. Those present led by
Colonel John Page drew up plans for such an institution and asked the Governor
and the King's Council to explain to the rulers of England and to Parliament the
purpose and the need of a college in Virginia and to make a request for financial
contributions for such an enterprise. Reverend James Blair, a Scotch minister in
Virginia, went to England to ask King William III and Queen Mary for their
consent. He stayed in England for two years and, upon his return, had a royal
charter and numerous contributions consisting of land, special tax funds and
personal finances which had been encouraged and strongly supported by King
William and Queen Mary. Donations from interested colonists themselves increased
the building fund considerably. On February 8, 1693, the official charter
for the college was granted. The college was named William and Mary College
in honor of the King and Queen who had granted its charter. Out of respect for
King William who belonged to the House of Orange, the official college colors
were designated as orange and white. The General Assembly selected Middle
Plantation as the most suitable location for the college and the plans for the
original building were drawn up by the now-famous architect, Sir Christopher
Wren. The Wren Building, named in his honor, was constructed by 1698 and it
is the oldest academic structure still in existence. William and Mary College was
the second oldest college established in America: Harvard College, located in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, having been established in 1636. The first regular
faculty consisted of six professors and Reverend Blair, who had personally raised
much of the fund for the college, became its first president.</p>

<p>After the burning of Jamestown during Bacon's Rebellion, the State House was
rebuilt, but it burned again in October 1698. Since the Assembly then had no
meeting place, it met in 1699 at the private residence of Mrs. Sarah Lee and in
a building of William and Mary College. At one meeting, Governor Granci
Nicholson suggested that the capital be moved to Middle Plantation. After a
successful vote, the seat of the Virginia Colony government was officially moved
from Jamestown, the first capital, to Middle Plantation, the name of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
changed to Williamsburg in honor of King William III. Plans for the State
House were immediately made and the main street was named Duke of Gloucester
Street, in honor of the Duke of Gloucester who was Queen Anne's oldest son.
The first official Capitol building was constructed at one end of the main street
and the College of William and Mary had been constructed at the other end.</p>

<p>In 1698, a Scotsman, Francis Makemie, a Presbyterian missionary, migrated
from Pennsylvania to Accomack County, Virginia, where he held services in his
home. He was soon arrested for not having a license to preach, but he was so
sincere in his religious beliefs that he was later awarded a license. He is the
founder of Presbyterianism in Virginia and, near Temperanceville, one may see
a monument consisting of a stone figure of Francis Makemie attired in his usual
clerical garb.</p>

<p>Shortly before the beginning of the eighteenth century, the General Assembly
passed an act requiring an import tax of twenty shillings upon each Negro imported
into the Virginia Colony. England, however, opposed such action and, as
additional laws were passed by the Virginia General Assembly levying high import
taxes on slaves, she consistently vetoed them. The number of Negroes in Virginia
increased as the production and the value of tobacco increased until, by 1700,
there were approximately 7,000 Negroes out of 72,000 inhabitants within the
colony. The colonists expressed their desire to prohibit or at least restrict the
importation of Negroes in 1713, but the mother country would not authorize the
Virginia Colony to forbid slave importation.</p>

<p>Another law passed at this time provided that any settler could buy an unlimited
area of land from the colony itself at the cost of five shillings per fifty acres.
This action was referred to as a "Treasury Right." Therefore, the "Head-Right"
system was no longer the most common method of acquiring land settlements in
the Virginia Colony. The population of the Virginia Colony was predominantly
English and all types of social classes were now represented here: from the aristocratic
nobles to the uncouth convicts. With the influx of the Cavaliers and with
the reputation of the prosperity of the Virginia Colony, the number of middle
class and upper class residents increased considerably during the Eighteenth
Century until such residents soon made up a majority of the inhabitants. By
1700, the population of Virginia was approximately 70,000 including about 5,500
Negroes.</p>

<p>By 1710, the practice had been established of allowing the Governor of a British
Colony to remain in England and to appoint deputies to live in the colony and
actually to rule the colony. At this time, Alexander Spotswood arrived in Virginia
as a royal Governor, technically the Deputy to Lord George Hamilton, Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Orkney, the official Lieutenant and Governor-General of the Virginia Colony.
He was the first royal Governor to live in the new Governor's Palace at Williamsburg.
Governor Spotswood remained in this position for twelve years and was
responsible for many improvements and much progress in the Virginia Colony.
He encouraged and helped carry out the beautifying of Williamsburg, the new
capital city. Ravines were filled, streets leveled, some college buildings, a public
magazine (a storehouse for arms and ammunition) and a church were erected
primarily due to his influence. Since he believed in developing the natural resources
of Virginia, he had iron foundries established along the Rapidan River,
near Fredericksburg. As a result, the first mining village in Virginia, Germanna,
located near the Blue Ridge Mountains, came into existence. This village was
named in honor of the German miners who came to Virginia to work the iron
mines and in honor of the German ruler, Queen Anne.</p>

<p>In 1716, the Governor and some friends started out to explore the Northwest.
They stopped at Germanna to shoe the horses as protection for them on the rocky,
mountain roads. The Governor traveled by stagecoach from Williamsburg to
Germanna. Here he changed to horseback and accompanied by two groups of
rangers and four Indian guides, in addition to the original group, he traced the
Rapidan River to its headwaters and then proceeded to climb the east side of the
Blue Ridge Mountains. They reached the top near Swift Run Gap and, from
this summit, viewed the great Shenandoah Valley and the Allegheny Mountains
about twenty miles away. They spent the night there on the summit and then
descended the west slope of the mountain, finally arriving at a river which they
called Euphrates. This same river is known today as the Shenandoah River, an
Indian name meaning "Daughter of the Stars." As had happened earlier on the
Batts-Fallon expedition, a volley of gunfire was shot, and Governor Spotswood
claimed possession of the land in the name of George I, then King of England.
The highest mountain peak which they had climbed they called Mount George
in his honor, and the next highest one was called Mount Alexander in honor of
the Governor himself. The expedition had been such a pleasant one for the
Governor that legend states that he sent to England for small individual golden
horseshoe pins with diamonds symbolizing the nailheads and presented one to each
of his companions on this memorable trip, bestowing upon them the title of
"Knights of the Golden Horseshoe." Governor Spotswood also was a most able
diplomat with the Indians, and he tried conscientiously to help them get better
educated. For example, he sent white teachers to help them to develop their
handicraft and the arts of civilization, and later, he encouraged many of the Indian
boys to attend William and Mary College where they could specialize in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
particular abilities. Spotswood was later appointed Postmaster General for the
Colonies and was responsible for initiating a postal system extending from Charleston
to Boston. Colonel Hugh Drysdale succeeded him as Governor for the next
four years.</p>

<p>In 1716, the first theater in America was built by William Levingston at
Williamsburg. It was constructed for the acting of "Comedies, Drolls and other
kind of stage plays ... thought fitt to be acted there." Mary Stagg, the wife of
Charles Stagg, who was the manager of the theater, is considered the first theatrical
leading lady in America. Although many British actors and musicians were participants
in this theater, it often suffered from financial stress. Thus, twenty-nine
years later, this theater was donated to Williamsburg to be used as a town hall.</p>

<p>In 1722, Williamsburg, the capital of Colonial Virginia (1699-1780), became
the first incorporated municipality in Virginia. It became the leading political,
economic, educational and social center of the colony, especially during legislative
sessions. Eight years after Williamsburg had been incorporated, William Parks
arrived there as a public printer. He set up the first permanent printing press in
Virginia and approximately six years later, Virginia's first colonial newspaper, the
"Virginia Gazette," was printed.</p>

<p>Colonel Robert Carter, President of the Council, succeeded Governor Drysdale
in July 1726. Carter was a very wealthy man whose land holdings&mdash;300,000
acres total&mdash;were second in Virginia only to the Fairfaxes. Because of his enormous
wealth and arrogant manner, he was nicknamed "King" Carter.</p>

<p>In 1728, William Byrd II was the leader of a survey group which followed
the Virginia-North Carolina borderline from the Atlantic Ocean two hundred
and forty miles westward. This action provided Virginians with knowledge of the
type of terrain and its potentiality along this important borderline.</p>

<p>It was in the period 1730-1760 that a majority of the beautiful brick and stone
plantation mansions were constructed. The wealthy families preferred the country-side.
Some of the mansions built at this time included Westover (William Byrd
family), Stratford Hall (Thomas Lee family), Ampthill (Archibald Cary family),
Carter's Grove (Robert Carter Burwell family) and Mount Airy (John Tayloe
family).</p>

<p>Sir William Gooch was acting chief executive of Virginia for twenty-two years,
1727-1749. His greatest project during this period was the development of settlements
in the Shenandoah Valley. At the beginning of the Eighteenth Century,
some Scotch-Irish, Germans and French Huguenots settled in Virginia. The
Scotch-Irish had migrated first to Pennsylvania and to New Jersey. Upon hearing
about the beautiful valley seen by Governor Spotswood, they decided to settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
there. Their main settlement was located in the area now included in the Winchester
and Staunton areas and in the counties of Augusta and Rockbridge. It
became so densely populated with people originally from Northern Ireland that
it was called the "Irish Tract." Later, additional Scots direct from Scotland
migrated here in large numbers. Germans had already migrated in large numbers
to Germanna, the mining town. The French Huguenot immigrants settled mainly
along both sides of the James River at Manakintown. Thus, the Shenandoah
Valley and the area beyond the Blue Ridge and the Allegheny Mountains were
colonized primarily by the Scotch-Irish, German, and French Huguenots.</p>

<p>Two years later, the Quakers organized a church at Hopewell which is the
oldest church in northern Virginia. Six years later, the oldest Lutheran church
in the South was built in Madison County by some of the Germans from Germanna.
Its financial support originally came from friends in Germany, and it was
called Hebron Church.</p>

<p>In 1749, Augusta Academy was founded by the Presbyterians in Augusta
County, and it was the first classical school located west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
Its name was later changed in 1775 to the patriotic title of Liberty Hall.
This academy was the forerunner of the Washington and Lee University.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas Lee was acting Governor from 1749 to 1751. He encouraged
westward expansion in the Virginia Colony and believed that the French should
be expelled from America. He was the father of the most famous family in Virginia
history: the Lee family. He built the now-famous family homestead, Stratford,
in Westmoreland County in 1725-1730. During his governorship, some
wealthy Virginians formed the Ohio Company whose purpose was to settle a
colony west of the Allegheny Mountains on a tract of land 500,000 acres in size.
Four years later, the company constructed a fort at the junction of the Allegheny
and Monongahela Rivers where the present city of Pittsburgh is now located.
One hundred and twenty miles north of this fort, the French proceeded to construct
Fort LeBoeuf on the Allegheny River. Since many Virginians and other
Englishmen from other colonies had been settling in the Ohio Valley, they became
much alarmed at the construction and occupation of this French fort. Consequently,
the British-Americans began to observe carefully the activities of the
French in this region. Colonel Lee had the unusual distinction of being the only
Virginian to have a Crown Commission of Governor awarded to him even though
he died before the commission reached him.</p>

<p>From 1721 to 1750, nineteen new counties were created: Hanover (formed
from New Kent and named for the Duke of Hanover who later became King
George of England), Spotsylvania (formed from Essex, King William and King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and Queen Counties and named for Lieutenant Governor Spotswood), King
George (formed from Richmond and later a part of Westmoreland County and
named for George I, King of England), Goochland (formed from Henrico
County and named for William Gooch, the Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia at
the time), Caroline (formed from Essex, King and Queen and King William
Counties and named for Queen Caroline, George II's wife), Prince William
(formed from Stafford and King George Counties and named for William Augustus,
Duke of Cumberland), Brunswick (formed from Prince George and parts
of Surry and Isle of Wight Counties and named for the Duchy of Brunswick in
Germany), Orange (formed from Spotsylvania and named for William, Prince
of Orange, an English king), Amelia (formed from Prince George and Brunswick
Counties and named for Princess Amelia, King George II's youngest daughter),
Fairfax (formed from Prince William County and named for Lord Fairfax),
Frederick (formed from Orange County and named for Frederick, Prince of
Wales, George II's son and George III's father), Louisa (formed from Hanover
County and named for King George II's daughter, Princess Louisa, who was also
the wife of King Frederick V of Denmark), Albemarle (formed from Goochland
County and named for William Anne Keppel, the second Earl of Albemarle,
Governor-General of the Colony who remained in England during the entire
time), Augusta (formed from Orange and named for Princess Augusta, wife of
Frederick, Prince of Wales, George III's father), Lunenburg (formed from Brunswick
and named for one of George I's titles: Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburg),
Chesterfield (formed from Henrico and named for the famous Lord Chesterfield,
Philip Dormer Stanhope), Culpeper (formed from Orange County and named
for Lord Thomas Culpeper, Governor of Virginia, 1680-1683), Southampton
(formed from Isle of Wight County and named for Henry Wriothesley, the third
Earl of Southampton and a leading member of the Virginia Company) and
Cumberland (formed from Goochland County and part of Buckingham County
and named in honor of William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland).</p>

<p>By 1750, the Virginia colony was enjoying prosperity. Numerous large plantations
had come into existence. As more and more soil became impoverished due
to a lack of crop rotation, non-use of fertilizer and the intensive planting of the
tobacco crop which requires a rich soil, additional land was purchased and added
to the existing homestead. Consequently, plantations of 100,000 to 300,000 acres
became common, especially around the Tidewater area. The larger the tobacco
plantation, the greater the need for cheap labor became apparent. Consequently,
the number of Negro slaves increased in Virginia until by 1750, there were
approximately 115,000 Negroes and approximately 170,000 free whites. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
increase in huge plantations caused the middle class tobacco farmer to migrate
westward as he could not successfully compete with the larger tobacco planters.
The Virginia plantation owners had become accustomed at this time to allowing
the London tobacco merchants to act as their bankers: they would order their
necessities, supplies and luxuries (glass, silver, china) via their tobacco credits.
Such a system furnished an immediate advantage for the plantation owners but
also created a situation whereby the Virginia planters became heavily indebted
financially to the London merchants. The plantation owners also became the
influential individuals within the colony&mdash;politically, economically and socially.
Thus, Virginia at this time was practically ruled by an aristocracy. Although the
governing power of the assembly had increased gradually, the political power of
the commoner or average citizen had not increased accordingly. Membership in
the Virginia Council was considered a position of the greatest prestige and was
almost an hereditary position. The two required qualifications were wealth and
social position. The era of aristocratic living which predominated in the Virginia
Colony between 1700-1750 is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Virginia's
colonial history.</p>


<h3><em>The Pre-Revolutionary War Era</em></h3>

<p>While Robert Dinwiddie was the acting Governor of Virginia, the English and
French rivalry in colonial settlements was becoming bitter in America. In 1753,
Governor Dinwiddie selected George Washington to visit General St. Pierre, the
commander in charge of the French fort at Presque Isle on the shore of Lake Erie,
and to inform him that the Ohio country belonged to the English and that he
should withdraw his troops from there at once. Dinwiddie sincerely believed that
the land upon which the French fort had been built was English territory. Washington
and four comrades rode on horseback from Williamsburg to Fredericksburg
where he hired Jacob Vanbraam as an interpreter since Washington could not
speak French. They rode to Alexandria where Washington purchased food and
essential equipment because there were no towns between Alexandria and Winchester.
Two weeks later he reached Winchester, after having made the dangerous
crossing of the unbridged Shenandoah River. At Winchester, Washington
hired a well-known guide, Christopher Gist, to assist him on his journey to Fort
LeBoeuf where the French General had arrived to supervise its fortifications.
Two Indian traders also accompanied him. They traveled to Maryland and to
Pennsylvania until they reached the French fort, Fort LeBoeuf. The destination
was approximately five hundred miles from Williamsburg. Although St. Pierre
was polite and friendly, Washington was informed that the French had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
ordered to eject every Englishman from the Ohio Valley and that the French had
the rightful claim to such territory. Before he departed, Washington noticed a
large fleet of birch-bark canoes and boats of pine and was convinced that a war
between the English and French would be necessary to settle the dispute over
the control of the Northwest.</p>

<p>Washington returned to Williamsburg in January 1754, and reported to Governor
Dinwiddie a detailed account of his journey. Washington then prepared a
written report which persuaded the members of the General Assembly to realize
the seriousness of this matter. Colonel Joshua Fry, with Washington second in
command, marched with a troop of one hundred and fifty men against the French
in the Ohio Valley. On March 28, near Great Meadows, Washington's group
killed the French commander, Coulon de Jumonville, and killed or captured all
his soldiers except one. On March 31, 1754, Washington was granted a commission
as Lieutenant Colonel of the Virginia Regiment, which he later received
at Gadsby's Tavern in Alexandria. In the meantime, Colonel Fry had died suddenly
from an accidental fall, and Washington had succeeded to the command.</p>

<p>Fort Necessity, near Farmington, Pennsylvania, a crude structure of defense,
was in the process of being constructed by the Virginians at the forks of the Ohio
River when seven hundred French soldiers appeared, outnumbering the Virginian
troops by at least four hundred men. Washington and his troops were forced to
surrender, were allowed to leave with the honors of war and finally trudged back
to Winchester. The Battle of Great Meadows and the Battle of Fort Necessity
were of historical importance because they marked the beginning of the French
and Indian War in America, they were actually the first fighting attacks in the
Seven Years War in Europe between the English and the French, and they provided
the first real combat fighting experience for George Washington who was only
twenty-two years old at the time. The French proceeded to occupy Fort Necessity
and after improving it considerably, they changed its name to Fort Duquesne, in
honor of Canada's governor.</p>

<p>The following summer, in 1755, Washington returned with a larger army to
the Ohio area. Two regiments, one thousand, of British regulars had been sent
from England under the command of General Edward Braddock. These soldiers
arrived at Alexandria from England, and Washington, having been assigned as
an aide-de-camp to General Braddock, joined them there. A conference of five
royal Governors&mdash;Dinwiddie (Virginia), Morris (Pennsylvania), Sharp (Maryland),
DeLacey (New York) and Shirley (Massachusetts)&mdash;was held at the
Carlyle House in Alexandria on April 14 to formulate plans for the protection of
the western frontier against the French and Indian raids along the Ohio River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
After much discussion, a campaign plan was adopted whereby General Braddock
was to capture Fort Duquesne and expel the French from the Ohio Valley. At
this same conference, the suggestion was made that the British Ministry could
levy taxes on the colonies to help pay the expense of the war.</p>

<p>Braddock and his troops marched westward from Alexandria into western
Pennsylvania near Fort Duquesne through dense wilderness from April 12 to
July 9. General Braddock had been accustomed to fighting the European tactics
way, but he was wholly unfamiliar with Indian and ambush fighting. Washington
anxiously warned Braddock of ambush possibilities, but Braddock continued to
have his army march in regular step in close order and in full uniform regalia
through the underbrush. Indian scouts daily reported the progress of Braddock's
army to the French at Fort Duquesne. When the British troops were within eight
miles of the fort, they were attacked by the French and the Indians. The Virginia
soldiers, many of whom were experienced in wilderness fighting, ran for cover
behind the trees. Braddock, however, ordered his men to keep their formation
and fire simultaneously. Thus, they were easy targets for the French and the
Indians. Finally, they became so frightened at this unusual type of fighting that
they broke ranks and tried to flee. Half of Braddock's 1600 troops were killed or
wounded, Braddock himself being fatally wounded in action. This defeat occurred
on July 9, 1755.</p>

<p>In addition to this military slaughter, numerous Cherokee Indian raiding parties
took place from 1759-1760 in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia where homes
were burned and men, women and children were killed unmercifully. Washington
was put in charge of this frontier campaign with his headquarters at a fort
in Winchester. Eventually, the General Assembly of Virginia raised troops of its
own for its defense. The General Assembly then passed a law whereby a "Scalp
Market" was established, and anyone bringing male scalps of hostile Indians
above the age of twelve years to the market would receive ten pounds per scalp
in 1755 to forty-five pounds per scalp in 1758 when the law expired. In July, the
British General John Forbes with a large number of English soldiers and some
Cherokee allies went to Fort Duquesne via Philadelphia. They were rejoined in
September by Colonel Washington. Fort Duquesne was finally won by the English
and colonial and Indian soldiers, and Washington, himself, raised the British
flag over its ruins on November 25, 1758, ending the Indian attacks also on the
frontier. Fort Duquesne had its name changed to Fort Pitt in honor of William
Pitt the Elder, a British statesman, who had given ample support to Virginia's
colonial policies. Thus, the inhabitants of Virginia played their role in the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and Indian War, apparently a misnomer because the war was actually fought
between the French and the Indians and the British and the Indians.</p>

<p>In December 1763, Patrick Henry distinguished himself as a young lawyer by
challenging the authority of Parliament and the King in a case commonly called
the "Parsons' Cause." The Church of England was the established church of
Virginia, and the people were taxed for the parsons' salaries. Because coin money
was scarce in the colonies, Virginia, like the other colonies, had adopted the
custom of paying their clergymen in tobacco. One disadvantage of this system
was the fluctuation of the value of the tobacco, based upon the law of supply and
demand. Whenever there was a tobacco crop failure, the value of tobacco increased
considerably. This occurred in 1758 when there was so little tobacco available
that the House of Burgesses passed a law stating that all debts payable ordinarily
in tobacco might be paid in money at the rate of two pence per pound of tobacco.
The parsons' salary was 16,000 pounds of tobacco. When the above law was
passed allowing the parsons to be paid in money, they felt that it was unfair
because tobacco at that time was more valuable at the rate of six pence per pound
of tobacco than the money value itself. Furthermore, the parsons had had to
accept the same amount of tobacco when the prices had previously declined. King
George agreed with the parsons and requested that they be given their 16,000
pounds of tobacco or else a sum of money equivalent to the amount which 16,000
pounds of tobacco would be worth. Such an order was contrary to the law passed
by the House of Burgesses and was a continuation of a custom which England
had been using of "disallowing" a law passed by the colonial legislature. The
Burgesses refused to accept the "disallowing" of their law; in turn, the parsons,
knowing that the King had favored their opinion in the matter, took their problem
to the Hanover County Court as they believed they were entitled to the back pay
for the time which the House of Burgesses' law was in effect. The court had ruled
that the parsons were entitled to the back pay and was ready to proceed with the
problem of deciding upon the amount which it believed was due each parson.</p>

<p>When this case was first brought to the court for consideration, the individual
citizens of the colony tried to obtain the services of a lawyer who would fight
against the parsons. Since such a lawyer would be fighting not only against the
parsons but against the King himself, some of the lawyers, when asked to act as
attorney against the parsons, refused the offer. Patrick Henry, who was only
twenty-seven at the time and practically an unknown individual as far as law was
concerned, accepted the offer. The self-educated Hanover County resident surprised
the people in the court when he began to speak, at first hesitatingly and
then most confidently. He first criticized the parsons for trying to take advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the scarcity of the tobacco which caused its extraordinarily high price. He then
dared to speak against the British Parliament and the King for usurping the power
of "disallowing" a law passed by the Virginia legislature. The following quotation
illustrates the strong language which he used to express his attitudes in these
matters: "The king, by ... disallowing acts of this salutary nature, from being the
Father of his people degenerates into a Tyrant, and forfeits all the rights to his
subjects' obedience." Thus, he questioned the right of the King to veto a colonial
law. He followed these words with comments concerning the rights and privileges
of the colonists and the unjust taxing of the colonists for goods brought to the
Virginia Colony from England. The jury handed down the verdict that the parsons
were entitled to their back pay but awarded damages of one penny to each
parson. As a direct result of this case, Patrick Henry became famous and he
became a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses shortly afterward. He had
dramatically, though unexpectedly, expressed the attitude of most of the colonists
toward Parliamentary and royal control of their colony.</p>

<p>In spite of Patrick Henry's strong protests against the taxes imposed upon the
colonists, Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 whereby the colonists were
required to put stamps of differing value upon wills, deeds, mortgages, newspapers,
almanacs, advertisements, college diplomas and all other legal documents. This
tax was not directly levied for protection as the regular duty tax on imports had
been but was levied for revenue purposes. The revenue from the sale of these
stamps was to be used in paying the governmental cost in the territory acquired
from the French and Indian War and for defending the colonists. Previous acts
and taxes had affected a comparatively small number of colonists and usually only
one or two social classes. The Stamp Act, however, affected practically every class,
particularly editors, lawyers and parsons who usually exert strong influence upon
any group of people. The Stamp Act was the controversial issue at the time Patrick
Henry became a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. Some of the members
felt that Parliament had the right to tax the colonists and others felt that
it was illegal for them to do so. Patrick Henry offered five resolutions against the
Stamp Act to the effect that the "General Assembly of the colony have the only
sole and exclusive right and power to levy taxes." A fiery discussion then occurred
over these resolutions, and, after hearing the heated arguments on both sides
on May 29, 1765, Patrick Henry rose in the House and described Virginia as
being tethered in chains under the rule of Parliament and the King. Then he
shouted: "Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I, his Cromwell, and George III...."
Here he was interrupted by cries of "Treason! Treason!" Very calmly he finished
the sentence by saying "may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
most of it!" Patrick Henry's brilliant oratory persuaded public opinion again, and
his "Virginia Resolves" against the Stamp Act were passed by a majority of one
vote. Such a small majority seems insignificant, but these Resolves were publicized
throughout the colonies and played an important part in creating serious
opposition to England throughout the British colonies. Soon similar resolutions
were adopted in the other colonies.</p>

<p>The first Colonial Congress was called to meet in New York City in October
1765 to form a plan of resistance to the Stamp Act. Although delegates from
nine colonies attended, Virginia was not represented because the Virginia legislature
had adjourned before Massachusetts had sent its invitation circular to her.
However, Virginia approved a three point program of this "Stamp Act Congress"
at its next legislative session: namely, a Bill of Rights, a statement of grievances
and the principle of no taxation without actual representation. The colonists believed
that, since they had no actual representation in Parliament, there could
be no taxation except that authorized by their individual legislatures. Therefore,
the members of the Stamp Act Congress adopted petitions to the King, the House
of Commons and the House of Lords asking repeal of the Stamp Act. This congress
was the first significant step in the direction of unity for the British colonies
in America. In addition to this orderly method of opposition, in some of the
colonies mob violence, rioting and even personal molesting of the stamp officials
took place.</p>

<p>On February 8, 1766, the Northampton County Court severely opposed the
Stamp Act by stating that "the said act did not bind, affect or concern the inhabitants
of this colony, inasmuch as they conceive the same to be unconstitutional,
and that the said several officers may proceed to the execution of their respective
offices, without incurring any penalties by means thereof."</p>

<p>On February 27, 1766, a group of one hundred and fifteen planters met at
Leedstown in the Northern Neck to publicly oppose the Stamp Act. A series of
resolves or resolutions written by Richard Henry Lee but presented by Thomas
Ludwell Lee, his brother, were passed by those present. These resolves condemned
the Stamp Act and defiantly acclaimed the rights which they considered essential
to civil liberty. These resolves are usually referred to as the Leedstown or Westmoreland
Resolves because they were presented at Leedstown which is located in
Westmoreland County. In March of the same year a pamphlet, entitled "An
Enquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies," was written and circulated by
Richard Henry Bland which strongly opposed the Parliamentary measures and
stated that the colonies were bound to England directly by the King and not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Parliament. Therefore, Bland concluded that Parliament technically had no
jurisdiction over the American colonies.</p>

<p>Finally, on March 18, 1766, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act but at the
same time passed the Declaratory Act stating that Parliament had the authority
to pass laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." In their triumph over the
repeal of the Stamp Act, many of the colonists overlooked the strong, powerful
wording of the Declaratory Act.</p>

<p>Soon after the repeal of the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts were passed in
1767. They were called the Townshend Acts because the British Chancellor of
the Exchequer (a position similar to the present-day United States Secretary of
the Treasury) who originated them was Charles Townshend. The acts placed a
duty (an external tax) upon glass, paper, painters' colors, white lead and tea. The
revenue collected from these duties was to be used for the payment of salaries of
judges and other colonial officials in the attempt to make such positions less influenced
by the colonial legislature. The colonists objected strongly to the Townshend
Acts, again stating that the taxes so collected were for the purpose of revenue
and not for protection.</p>

<p>The merchant class of the large cities in the colonies and the Virginia planters
in particular were so strongly affected by these acts that they formed a retaliatory
organization called the Non-Importation Association. Although Lord Botetourt,
the royal Governor of Virginia at this time, dissolved the Virginia Assembly, and
individual members met privately at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg and
agreed to enter into such a non-importation agreement. This group agreed not to
import slaves, wines or goods from Great Britain unless the objectionable taxes
were abolished. This agreement caused a great reduction in the number of imports
from Great Britain to these colonies. Since Virginia had the largest amount of
commerce trade in England at this time, this method proved effective. Acts of
violence even occured in some of the colonies&mdash;for example, the Boston Massacre.
Finally, on March 5, 1770, the Townshend Acts were repealed with the exception
of the tax on tea: three pence per pound. This tax was retained supposedly to
assert the right of Parliament to tax the colonists whenever it so desired.</p>

<p>In spite of this repeal, friction between colonial legislatures and royal Governors
continued. Under the leadership of Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, Committees
of Correspondence were appointed in 1773 whose chief objective was to keep the
various colonies informed by correspondence of the events occurring within their
colony which were contrary to the rights and privileges of the colonists. The
Virginia General Assembly appointed a Committee of Correspondence under the
leadership of Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry and George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Mason. The condition which caused this permanent committee to be organized at
this time was the continuous threat of England to force Americans to be tried in
England for offenses against the law. These committees within the various colonies
became very active and persuasive. The British soon abandoned their idea of
sending Americans to England to be tried. However, these committees increased
rapidly in number as the grievances of the colonists increased, and they gradually
created a feeling of unity in the colonies as a result of a better understanding of
common problems.</p>

<p>The next act which is believed to have led directly to the Revolutionary War
is the Tea Act. After the three pence per pound tax on tea was levied, some of
the colonists bought their tea from smugglers who had purchased it from the
Dutch East Indies. In 1773, in an attempt to curb this illegal trade and to help
create a monopoly of the tea trade for the East India Company, Parliament passed
a law allowing this company to ship tea from Asia directly to the American colonies
without bringing it to English warehouses first, as had previously been the
regulation. This situation resulted in the East India Company selling its tea
cheaper than the other companies. In spite of this change, Parliament refused to
repeal the three pence duty tax on tea which still had to be paid by the colonists.</p>

<p>The American colonists realized the scheme of England, and not wanting to
admit the right of Parliament to tax them even under these conditions, they
decided not to submit to the payment of the duty tax. When the ships from the
East India Company sent cargoes of tea to Charleston, Philadelphia, New York
and Boston, some of it was stored indefinitely (at Charleston), some was returned
(from Philadelphia and from New York City) and the rest was dumped into the
Boston Harbor on December 16, 1773. The famous Boston Tea Party caused
Parliament to pass the "Intolerable Acts" as punishment for the colonists of
Massachusetts: (1) the Boston Port Bill closed the port of Boston to all trade
until the colonists there had paid for the tea which had been destroyed and had
agreed to obey the laws of Parliament and to maintain peace in the future, (2)
the Massachusetts Government Act changed the charter of Massachusetts so that
more governing power was in the hands of the royal officials and much less in the
hands of the colonists, (3) the Administration of Justice Act provided that British
officials in Massachusetts who had been charged with serious violations of colonial
laws were from that time on to be sent to England for their trial and (4) an act
provided that any colonial Governor was empowered from that time on to quarter
British soldiers in barns or vacant buildings whenever the need arose. The first
of these acts was to go into effect on June 1, 1774. Therefore, the colonists realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that something had to be done immediately if their resentment and ill feeling
was to be recognized by Parliament and acted upon accordingly.</p>

<p>A description of the Boston Tea Party first reached Virginia from a visitor to the
old Market Square in Alexandria. The Virginia House of Burgesses was in session
when the Virginians learned of the "Intolerable Acts." Led by Thomas Jefferson,
Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, the members of the House of Burgesses
passed a resolution designating June 1, the day on which the "Intolerable Acts"
were to be enforced, as a day of fasting and prayer to God to encourage Parliament
to abandon its unwise punitive policy towards the people of Massachusetts.
When Governor Lord Dunmore, who had succeeded upon the death of Governor
Botetourt, heard of this resolution, he dissolved the House of Burgesses. Before
all the members had left Williamsburg, a messenger arrived from Boston with a
circular letter which pleaded with the colonies for united support and which suggested
the cessation of all trading relations with Great Britain. The twenty-five
Burgesses members, who were in the Apollo Room of the Raleigh Tavern when
the letter arrived, discussed its contents and decided that it was too important a
matter for the Committee of Correspondence to assume complete responsibility.
Consequently, they asked the counties to appoint deputies to a special convention
to be held on August 1, 1774 at Williamsburg for a two-fold purpose: to consider
the possibility of complete cessation of trade with Great Britain and to choose
delegates to a proposed Continental Congress. Peyton Randolph, Speaker of the
House of Burgesses, is believed to have been the leader of this special convention
movement. The actual summons was signed by Thomas Jefferson, George Washington
and Henry Lee. The calling of this First Virginia Convention is most
significant in American history as well as in Virginia history because it was a
positive action on the part of the American colonists to assert the people's sovereignty
over and against the King's authority.</p>

<p>The convention at Williamsburg which began August 1, 1774 lasted for six
days and representatives attended from fifty-six counties and four boroughs. Each
county sent two delegates and each borough, one. Peyton Randolph was chosen
as president of the convention. The convention members agreed to purchase no
goods, with the exception of medicine, from Great Britain after November 1, 1774
and agreed neither to import slaves nor to buy imported slaves after November 1.
Seven members were selected to represent Virginia at a Continental or General
Congress: Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison, Patrick Henry, Richard Henry
Lee, Edmund Pendleton, Peyton Randolph and George Washington. The convention
delegates also stated that unless American grievances were diminished by
August 10, 1775, all exports of Virginia products to Great Britain would be stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
It was at this convention that a written treatise on American rights was prepared
for the convention by Thomas Jefferson. This paper, later entitled "A Summary
View of the Rights of British America," was published by the Virginia convention
and was responsible for making Jefferson's great ability as a writer well known.
This pamphlet was a forerunner of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>While the colonists were having political and economic difficulties with Great
Britain, other domestic difficulties were occurring on the frontiers. As mentioned
previously, the Piedmont area of Virginia, located between the Fall Line and the
Appalachian Mountains, was actually the first American frontier. People who
settled there came originally for several purposes: to acquire fertile but cheap
land, to enjoy new personal freedom (in many cases, the settlers were former
indentured servants), to carry on fur trade with the Indians, to obtain fresh pasture
land for cattle and to establish plantations. After the Piedmont area became
heavily settled, the westward movement continued. The settlements in the Shenandoah
Valley of Virginia followed directly after the crossing of the Blue Ridge
Mountains. In the late 1760's, William Bean, a Virginian, constructed the first
cabin along the Watauga River, and later, James Robertson and John Sevier
pioneered in the Watauga Valley. Settlements were also made at this time along
the fertile Holston River Valley in eastern Tennessee. During this period, Daniel
Boone explored the Cumberland Gap area and started a settlement in the region
now known as Kentucky. While he was taking a group of approximately eighty
settlers to this region, he was attacked by a band of Indians. The group decided
to return to North Carolina with the exception of the Boone family, and they
stopped near the Kentucky-Tennessee border.</p>

<p>Indian uprisings were common until the soldiers of Virginia defeated them in
Lord Dunmore's War. As the settlers pushed westward, more and more of the
Indians' hunting grounds were being seized and used for farming. Since the
Indians felt that this was most unjust treatment, they resorted to making war upon
the settlers. In 1774, many frontier Indian raids occurred involving the Shawnees,
Cherokees, Mingos, Delaware and Wyandots. One incident which had great
repercussion was the killing of nine members of the family of John Logan, a
friendly Mingo chief, by a group of white settlers. This incident caused the Indians
to be extremely revengeful.</p>

<p>When Lord Dunmore became the new royal Governor, the settlers appealed
to him for protection and asked that he send military troops at once. He decided
personally to command one group of troops at the Forks of the Ohio River and
he ordered Major Andrew Lewis, a pioneer's son of Augusta County whose father
had founded Staunton, Virginia, to raise a force of Virginia troops and bring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to a meeting-place located at Camp Union (now known as Lewisburg, West
Virginia). With approximately 1100 men, General Lewis started on his march
to the Ohio River in September 1774 to fight the Indians. After nineteen days
of marching, they arrived at Point Pleasant, the site at which the Kanawha River
empties into the Ohio River, approximately 160 miles from their starting point.
General Lewis and his troops waited four days and heard no word from Lord
Dunmore although he had ordered them to this particular position. On October
10, two of Lewis' men went hunting, strictly against his orders. Two miles from
camp they were attacked by the Shawnee Indians, and one of them was killed.
The other escaped, rushed back to the camp and reported to General Lewis that
he had observed "four acres of ground" of Indians. General Lewis then commanded
his men to form two lines of battle, one to be under the leadership of his
brother, Colonel Charles Lewis, and the other under the leadership of Colonel
William Fleming. He himself was to be the supreme commander. The battle
began immediately, and after the Indians rushed forward the first time, Charles
Lewis was killed and Colonel Fleming was wounded. The Indian leader was
Chief Cornstalk who was a popular and powerful Indian warrior. However, after
fighting all day, the Indians finally retreated across the Ohio River, and the Virginians
were considered the victors of the Battle of Point Pleasant or the Battle
of Great Kanawha because they were not driven back by the Indians. Consequently,
Lord Dunmore's War was fought without his presence, although it is
believed that he may have been negotiating a peace treaty with the Indians
simultaneously at some distant place. The winning of this war by the Virginians
made the winning of the west much easier for the later settlers.</p>

<p>On September 5, 1774, the first Continental Congress was called by Virginia,
and invitations were issued by Committees of Correspondence. The purpose of
this Congress was "to deliberate and determine wise and proper measures, to be
by them recommended to all the colonies, for the recovery and establishment of
their just rights and liberties, civil and religious, and the restoration of union and
harmony between Great Britain and the colonies most ardently desired by all
good men." The Continental Congress began in Carpenters' Hall, Philadelphia,
on September 5, 1774 with 56 members present. Two-thirds of these were lawyers,
and the membership itself consisted of representatives of both the liberal
and the conservative groups although the majority appeared to be in the former
group. The Virginian, Peyton Randolph, was unanimously elected President of
the First Continental Congress. During the Congress, Patrick Henry expressed
the need for unity when he exclaimed: "The distinctions between Pennsylvanians,
New Yorkers and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
but an American." Concerning its chief accomplishments, the Congress (1) drew
up a Declaration of Rights (a series of resolutions declaring that the colonists
were entitled to certain rights: life, liberty and property, the right to vote their
own taxes and the right to trial by jury; that these rights had been violated by
the King and by Parliament since 1673; that unjust taxes and standing armies
had been imposed upon them and their local assemblies unfairly interfered with
by Parliament; that their repeated petitions for a redress of their grievances had
been practically ignored in England) and (2) adopted "a non-importation, non-consumption
and non-exportation agreement" called the Continental Association
Plan. It should be noted that complete separation from England was not demanded
at this time but rather cooperation from, and peace under, English rule.
The session lasted approximately seven weeks, and then on October 26, 1774,
after a motion had been passed setting May 10, 1775 as the date of a second
congress meeting, the session was adjourned to await a reply from the King of
England.</p>

<p>The resolutions passed by this Congress were circulated throughout the colonies
for their approval. All sections of the Virginia colony approved them, even sections
as far west as the area now occupied by the State of Kentucky. Two illustrations
of such approval are the Fairfax Resolutions and the Fincastle Resolutions.
The freeholders of Fairfax County met in Alexandria in July 1774 and
passed the so-called Fairfax Resolutions, written by George Mason. The Fairfax
Resolutions or Resolves, as they are sometimes called, reflected Virginia's attitude
toward taxation, Parliament and even the King. In January 1775, at Lead Mines,
Fincastle County seat, the freeholders met and prepared a paper congratulating
and thanking the Virginia delegates for their part in the First Continental Congress.
These Fincastle Resolutions also included strong written opposition to English
tyrannical power.</p>

<p>In November 1774, Virginia had a tea party, similar in purpose to Boston in
that it was an act of defiance against Great Britain's tea tax. On November 7,
the Virginians discovered that a British ship, "Virginia," which had docked in the
York River at an earlier date, contained tea cargo. The Committee of Safety for
York County immediately sent to the House of Burgesses (which was meeting
at Williamsburg) a message in the form of a protest against accepting this tea
for sale in the colony. The Committee received a reply to the effect that the
matter would be discussed in the House and an answer would be forthcoming
the next Monday morning. Large groups of people gathered at Yorktown where
the boat had been docked and waited for the reply. The House of Burgesses failed
to send the reply, and the captain of the ship declared that he had received no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
message. The Committee waited a while longer and then proceeded to throw the
tea out of the ship's hold into the York River. By this time, the Yorktown inhabitants
had been informed of the "Intolerable Acts" which had been passed to
punish the inhabitants of Boston. Therefore, they filled the ship with necessary
supplies and sent it to the Bostonians. This incident was another example of the
methods by which the colonists were learning to unite and to help each other in
their common objectives.</p>

<p>When the American colonists began to carry out the non-importation agreement,
the British merchants were very much affected: for example, the import
trade from Great Britain to the American colonies declined about 95% by 1775.
The Americans had some great British leaders on their side, but they were
definitely in the minority. Edmund Burke and William Pitt urged that the
"Intolerable Acts" be repealed and predicted that war was approaching with the
American colonies if most of the objectionable laws were not repealed at this
time. Burke and Pitt were overruled, however, in Parliament. Thus, the breach
between the American colonies and the mother country became wider as time
passed.</p>

<p>Continued growth in the number of counties reflected increases in population
and a trend toward the rising importance of community life. From 1750 to 1775,
several additional counties were formed: Halifax (formed from Lunenburg and
named for George Montagu Dunk, Second Earl of Halifax and the first Lord of
the Board of Trade), Dinwiddie (formed from Prince George County and named
for Lord Dinwiddie, acting Lieutenant Governor of the Virginia Colony from
1751-1758), Prince Edward (formed from Amelia County and named for Edward
Augustus, Prince of Wales), Bedford (formed from Lunenburg and part of
Albemarle County and named for John Russell, Fourth Duke of Bedford, Secretary
of State in Great Britain from 1748-1757), Sussex (formed from Surry
County and named for Sussex County, England), Loudoun (formed from Fairfax
County and named for John Campbell, Fourth Earl of Loudoun, Commander-in-Chief
of the British forces during the latter part of the French and Indian War
and Governor-General of the American Colonies from 1756 to 1763), Fauquier
(formed from Prince William County and named after Francis Fauquier, Lieutenant
Governor from 1758 to 1768), Buckingham (formed from Albemarle
County and named probably for the Duke of Buckingham), Charlotte (formed
from Lunenburg and named for Princess Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg,
George III's queen), Mecklenburg (formed from Lunenburg and named in honor
of the same queen, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz), Pittsylvania (formed
from Halifax County and named for Sir William Pitt, a famous English statesman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
who was pro-American toward the British Colonies in America), Botetourt (formed
from Augusta County and part of Rockbridge County and named for Norborne
Berkeley, Lord Botetourt, Governor of Virginia from 1768 to 1770) and Amherst
County (formed from Albemarle County "and certain islands in the Fluvanna
River" and named for Sir Jeffrey Amherst, Governor-General of Virginia, 1759-1768).</p>


<h3><em class="gesperrt">SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>The historical Life of Virginia from 1584 to 1775 illustrates the "trial and
error" method of learning to live cooperatively, comfortably and profitably in the
New World. The inhabitants of the "Cradle of American Civilization" were faced
with severe personal handicaps, problems of government (many of which had to
be solved in an original fashion), explorations into untrodden and often uncivilized
areas, the task of establishing a land economy, rebellions of the common
man against the privileged few and the establishment of a culture and way of life
adapted to the type of environment and peoples living in the area. The efforts of
such leaders as John Smith, John Rolfe, Edwin Sandys, George Yeardley, Benjamin
Syms, Thomas Eaton, James Blair, Alexander Spotswood, Thomas Lee, Robert
Dinwiddie, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Richard
Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Peyton Randolph and Andrew Lewis helped unite
the colonists in Virginia in their development of democratic living.</p>

<p>During this period, the first representative legislative assembly in America was
held, the first group of Negro slaves were imported to America, the first group
of unmarried women arrived in the colonies, the first royal colony of England was
organized, a county system of local government was established, the Commonwealth
of Virginia was created, the second oldest college in America was founded,
the first theater in America was built, many of the most beautiful plantation
houses were constructed, the British became the dominant colonists in America,
slavery became an accepted characteristic of plantation life, fifty-four counties
were formed and strong opposition of the colonists in Virginia to political and
economic control by the British King and Parliament was becoming very apparent.
The first special Virginia Convention held in Williamsburg to determine the
extent of Virginia's boycott of British goods and to choose delegates to a Continental
Congress and the York River Tea Party at Yorktown exemplified mounting
opposition. The stage of life in Virginia seemed naturally set for specific action
against strict foreign regulation and control.</p>

Historical Life: 1775-1860</h2>

<h3><em>The Revolutionary War Era</em></h3>


<p>A second Virginia Convention was held from March 20 to March 27,
1775 at St. John's Church, Richmond. Peyton Randolph was again chosen
president of the convention. The members of this convention soon were divided
into distinct groups: (1) the conservative group, led by Peyton Randolph, which
deplored radical thinking and actions and still favored reconciliation with the
mother country, England, and (2) the aggressive group, led by Patrick Henry,
which believed conciliation and compromise were no longer possible or feasible
and advocated military preparedness within the colony.</p>

<p>On the first day, March 20, Patrick Henry delivered his famous speech, the
most significant and oft-repeated section stating: "Gentlemen may cry: Peace!
Peace! but there is no peace. The war is actually begun!... Is life so dear or peace
so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take, but, as for me, give me liberty,
or give me death!" This fiery speech combined with his others earned for Patrick
Henry the title, "The Tongue of the Revolution" or "The Mouthpiece of the
Revolution." The first three days passed without either group committing itself.
On the fourth day, however, a resolution was adopted bestowing thanks upon
the Assembly of Jamaica for its petition to the King on behalf of the American
colonies and stating an ardent desire for peace. Patrick Henry then proposed an
unusual resolution to follow the preceding one, namely: the establishment of "a
well-regulated militia, composed of gentlemen and yeomen." His brilliant oratorical
powers of persuasion caused the resolution to be carried, and the military
resources of the colony were immediately directed to be organized and made
efficient. The convention also appealed to all the people for contributions for the
relief of the Bostonians because they were "suffering in the common cause of
American freedom." Later at this convention, delegates to the Second Continental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Congress were elected: Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee,
Peyton Randolph and George Wythe.</p>

<p>On April 21, 1775, Governor Dunmore, who had unsuccessfully tried to prevent
the Richmond convention from taking place in order that delegates could
not be elected to attend the Second Continental Congress, became very much
aroused over the bitter feeling of the colonists toward Great Britain. He decided
that he could break down some of the colonial assuredness and resistance against
the King and against his personal orders if he could remove from the powder
magazine at Williamsburg the munition powder which belonged to the colony.
Therefore, he ordered twenty sailors from a British ship anchored at Williamsburg
to obtain this powder. They hid in the Governor's Palace; during the night, they
visited the magazine, removed all the powder which they could fit into the
Governor's wagon and took it to their armed ship, the "Fowey," in the harbor for
safekeeping. When the colonists learned the next morning of this activity, a
company of Hanover volunteers, led by Patrick Henry, marched upon Williamsburg
and forced the King's sailors to compensate by giving bills for the value of
the powder taken from the magazine. Governor Dunmore was then beseeched to
pay for the cost of the powder, at least in sterling. He finally paid this amount
because of the persistence of Patrick Henry. Only strenuous efforts on the part
of Patrick Henry's personal friends kept him and the local militia from imprisoning
the Governor himself for such action. Patrick Henry was declared an outlaw
by Governor Dunmore. Anti-British feeling rapidly increased on the part of the
colonists after this incident.</p>

<p>Approximately a week after this unpleasant incident, John Paul Jones, a
Scottish-Virginian who was a resident of Fredericksburg, recommended that the
colonies should have an official navy. He was a former British seaman, and he
offered his services to the colonies at this time in an attempt to raise a naval force.
The Second Continental Congress later appointed a Naval Committee whose
chief duty was to organize a naval force. At its invitation, John Paul Jones
explained to the Committee the great strength of the British Navy and the futility
of the colonists to try to compete with it. He stated, however, that, if the colonists
had fifteen ships armed with guns, these could be successfully utilized to annoy
British ships. His suggestion was accepted, and thirteen frigates plus two brigs
made up the first American Navy. John Paul Jones received the first naval commission
at Independence Hall on December 22, 1775. Therefore, he is often
referred to as "The Father of the American Navy."</p>

<p>Before the Second Continental Congress was due to meet, the Battle of Lexington
and Concord (near Boston) had taken place on April 19, 1775. After this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
"shot heard 'round the world," the Americans were most sympathetic toward their
fellow-colonists of Massachusetts. On May 10, 1775, the Second Continental
Congress began in Independence Hall, Philadelphia. Although there was a majority
of the members who now believed a revolution was inevitable, there were
also many conservatives who preferred compromise of any type rather than war.
This congress proceeded to take necessary steps for organizing and equipping an
American army. On June 16, 1775, it assumed control of the colonial forces
already formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after the Battle of Lexington and
Concord. It appointed George Washington as Commander-in-Chief of this
American Continental Army and assumed complete responsibility for the salaries
and supplies of the servicemen.</p>

<p>On June 1, 1775 Governor Dunmore called the Virginia House of Burgesses
together for the purpose of discussing some British proposals originated by Lord
North. The members did not favor these, however, and proceeded to suggest the
levying of a tax of five pounds per head on each imported slave as an attempt
to raise revenue for payment of the recent Lord Dunmore War with the Indians.
In order to protect the slave trade benefits for England, the Governor vetoed this
proposal. This action was his last veto in the Colony of Virginia. Later that
month, Lord Dunmore, sensing the sincerity of the Americans in this revolution,
feared for his royal governorship life. Consequently, on June 8, he fled from
Williamsburg to a British man-of-war ship, the "Fowey," in the Yorktown harbor.
His flight practically dissolved the royal government in Virginia. The Virginia
Assembly asked Governor Dunmore to return under its protection but he refused
to do so. His refusal to return after an official petition had been issued was considered
by the Virginians as abdication on his part from office. Thus, when it
adjourned on June 20, 1775, the last Virginia colonial General Assembly ended.</p>

<p>On July 3, 1775, Washington took official command of the American Continental
Army at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his first military objective was to
drive the British away from Boston. After he had been there a few weeks, he
visited some troops for inspection. Upon inquiring about the place of origin of
one company, he was surprised and delighted to hear the answer, "General, from
the Banks of the Potomac." The speaker was Daniel Morgan, who had accompanied
his corps of riflemen from Winchester, Virginia to Boston, 600 miles distance
in twenty-one days without a single death. Morgan had fought with Washington
during the French and Indian War and had participated in the war against
the Indians in the Ohio Valley campaign. Washington was so happy to see these
fellow-Virginians that he took time from his busy schedule to shake hands personally
with each member of the corps. After Morgan and his troops had participated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
successfully in the Massachusetts Campaign, he later sent them to Canada
for the Quebec campaign. This campaign unfortunately resulted in a defeat for
the Americans, and Morgan was taken prisoner. Although Morgan was offered
a commission in the British army while he was imprisoned, he violently rejected
the offer. Although he remained a prisoner for a long time, he rejoined the
American Army as soon as he was free to do so. The famous American victory at
the Battle of Saratoga is now accredited to the military strategy and tactics of
General Daniel Morgan. Another important later victory for which he was
directly responsible was the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina. He is one of
the many great military men furnished by the colony and by the state of Virginia.</p>

<p>From July 17 to August 26, 1775, the Third Virginia Convention was held.
The meeting place was Richmond, and Peyton Randolph was elected president
of the convention. George Mason had been appointed to succeed George Washington
at this convention because Washington was busily engaged as Commander-in-Chief
of the American Army. Since Governor Dunmore had already fled from
the colony, the royal government had been theoretically dissolved and Virginia
gained the status of an independent state. Therefore, the members of this convention
believed that they had to assume responsibility for governing Virginia
under the circumstances. Consequently, the one hundred and fifteen delegates
present proposed acts and passed them as laws called ordinances. Ordinances
passed contained the following provisions: (1) the organization of military forces
for the defense of Virginia into two regiments; (2) the creation of an executive
body called the Committee of Safety to act as the government while the convention
was in recess; (3) a plan for adequate revenue for the provisional government
and for the Army of Virginia; (4) the establishment of executive county committees;
(5) the regulation of the election of delegates to future conventions;
(6) the election of new representatives to a future Continental Congress, and
(7) the division of Virginia into sixteen military districts.</p>

<p>On August 17, 1775, the first Committee of Safety for Virginia was appointed
by the Virginia Convention of July 1775. It consisted of eleven members, namely,
Richard Bland, Carter Braxton, William Cabell, Paul Carrington, Dudley Digges,
Thomas Ludwell Lee, George Mason, James Mercer, John Page, Edmund Pendleton
and John Tabb. Edmund Pendleton was the chairman of this committee.
Various members of the Committee of Safety actually ruled Virginia from the
time it ceased to be a British colony until it officially became an independent state.</p>

<p>On December 1, 1775 the Fourth Virginia Convention was held at Richmond,
but soon after the convention had become organized, it moved to Williamsburg.
Edmund Pendleton was elected president of the convention. The chief problem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of this convention was military protection and security for Virginia in the face
of war. The army was increased from two regiments to nine regiments with an
enlistment requiring two years of military service. The chief measures passed
during the Fourth Virginia Convention of December 1775-January 1776 included
the appointment of a commission of five men in each county to try cases of those
individuals believed to be enemies of America, the creation of an admiralty court
to hear cases involving maritime or naval affairs, the granting of permission for
county courts to elect a sheriff for a one-year term and the issuing of special
instructions to the Virginia delegates to the next Continental Congress to encourage
the opening of American ports to the commerce of all foreign nations except
Great Britain and the British West Indies. It was also decided at this convention
to allow the Virginia troops to be merged or absorbed into the Continental Army
and to have future military officers commissioned by the Continental Congress
rather than by individual state or colonial legislatures. Another Committee of
Safety for Virginia was named: nine members were re-appointed and two new
members were substituted. Edmund Pendleton was still the chairman and the
other committee members were Richard Bland, William Cabell, Paul Carrington,
Dudley Digges, Joseph Jones, Thomas Ludwell Lee, James Mercer, John Page,
John Tabb and Thomas Walker. On January 20, 1776, the convention adjourned.</p>

<p>During the convention, another Lord Dunmore episode took place. Lord
Dunmore had become a real threat to the Virginians because, after he had fled
from Williamsburg and from Yorktown, he armed many Negroes and persuaded
them to fight for the King in return for their future freedom. He commanded
a force which at this time was in possession of Norfolk and its adjacent areas.
Eight days after the convention began, Lord Dunmore dispatched a few of his
British regulars to attack some of the Virginian troops under Colonel William
Woodford. These Virginians had constructed a breastwork along the southern
branch of the Elizabeth River, approximately twelve miles from Norfolk. Colonel
Woodford's Virginia troops killed almost all the British regulars, much to the
surprise of Lord Dunmore, who quickly retreated to a part of the British fleet
docked in Norfolk harbor. Later, while the convention was still in session, on
January 1, 1776, Lord Dunmore with a small land and sea force bombarded and
burned Norfolk itself which consisted of about 6,000 residents at the time. Many
houses were completely burned and others badly damaged. St. Paul's Church
was the only building to survive this bombardment and embedded cannon balls
in the south wall of the church may still be seen which were fired from the ships
in the harbor. Dunmore and his forces finally sailed up the Chesapeake Bay and
stationed themselves off Gwynn's Island, near the present Mathews County<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
mainland. From this area, Dunmore and his friends made repeated plunder
attacks along the coast of Virginia until summer.</p>

<p>During the same month of January, a dramatic episode occurred at Woodstock.
John Peter Gabriel M&#252;hlenberg, an ex-German soldier who had migrated to Virginia
and had become a minister, was very strongly pro-Virginia and very strongly
anti-British King. He had received a military commission as a colonel from
General George Washington due to his past military experience. His duty was
to form a regiment of Germans living in the valley. On this particular Sunday,
he ascended the pulpit and began to preach concerning the theme, "There is a
time to every purpose ... a time to war and a time to peace!" He proceeded to
describe the unjust treatment which the American colonies had received from the
British King and the Parliament. At the conclusion of his sermon, he stated:
"There is a time for all things&mdash;a time to preach and a time to pray; but there
is a time to fight, and that time has come now." With these surprising words, he
threw back his minister's attire and stood fully clothed in the blue and buff uniform
of a Continental Colonel with the official sword at his side. He immediately
descended from the pulpit and, in a very short time, had enlisted three hundred
citizens within this small community in the Eighth Virginia Regiment. Thus,
M&#252;hlenberg earned for himself the title of the "Fighting Parson" and with his
regiment marched directly to help the South Carolina Army. The regiment was
later referred to as the German Regiment because it was made up solely of
German Americans. It served with great honor during the Revolutionary War.
M&#252;hlenberg himself had the distinction of being with General Washington when
Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown.</p>

<p>The Fifth Virginia Convention, now called the Virginia Constitutional Convention,
began on May 6, 1776 at Williamsburg. By this time, the British had
been driven out of Boston and out of the New England area in general. The
American attempt to invade Canada had been unsuccessful, but the British had
been defeated in North and South Carolina. Public opinion in Virginia which
had been only "lukewarm" to complete separation from England at the early
stages of the war now became very strongly in favor of it&mdash;particularly after the
bombardment and burning of Norfolk. Most of the delegates had been instructed
before coming to the convention to work toward two specific objectives: American
independence and a representative government for Virginia. There were one
hundred and thirty-one delegates present at this convention, representing sixty-six
counties and corporations. Some of the outstanding members at this convention
were James Madison, Edmund Randolph and Archibald Cary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The various sections of Virginia were represented at the Fifth Convention.
The type of clothing worn at the convention made the sections easily recognizable:
there was an outstanding contrast between the homespun, practical clothing of
the frontiersmen and the fancy British-made clothing of the wealthy traders and
plantation owners. The convention members elected delegates to the Continental
Congress and instructed them to propose American independence from England.
The delegates chosen were George Washington, John Blair, James Madison,
George Mason, James McClurg, Edmund Randolph and George Wythe. On
May 15, a resolution was introduced by Archibald Cary and passed which declared
the colony of Virginia a free and independent State. Immediately the
British flag was lowered from the Capitol at Williamsburg and the colonial colors
were raised instead. At this same convention, on May 27, Archibald Cary presented
to the members the "Declaration of Rights" prepared by George Mason
for this convention. This document stated the fundamental rights of English
colonists as well as of Englishmen.</p>

<p>On June 12, 1776 Mason's "Declaration of Rights" was unanimously adopted.
Its principles were considered so important that they were later the basis of the
Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution and eventually were used as the
background for state constitution Bills of Rights. The Virginia Bill of Rights is
often referred to as the "Magna Charta of Virginia." George Mason also recommended
the original motto of the official seal of the State of Virginia at this convention:
"Sic Semper Tyrannis"&mdash;"Thus Always (or ever) to Tyrants."</p>

<p>In the same session, James Madison actively participated in a discussion concerning
religious liberty and tolerance. He proposed a clause in the Virginia Bill
of Rights to allow the "free exercise of religion" because he strongly believed that
the state should have no coercive power over religious thought. This clause was
adopted, and James Madison for the first time attracted state-wide attention to
his thinking and philosophy.</p>

<p>Once the idea of independence from England was formally expressed and a
specific objective was established, the Virginians at this convention proceeded to
write a state constitution for Virginia. This constitution, the first written state
constitution, was officially adopted on June 29, 1776, making this the birth date
of the State of Virginia. Since George Mason was primarily responsible for the
actual wording of the constitution, he is called the "Father of the Virginia Constitution."
Virginia was organized as the Commonwealth of Virginia, the name
believed patterned after the Commonwealth of England, the title acquired by the
government of England after its Civil War. The first constitution for Virginia
provided for a bicameral (two-house) legislature: the Senate and the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Delegates. Membership in these groups was to be by election by the qualified
voters. Each county was to choose two delegates annually to represent them and
one-fourth of the Senate was to be elected annually. The combined balloting of
the House and the Senate was to determine the election of the Governor (whose
term was to be one year with a maximum three years possible), an eight-man
Council of State and members of the Congress of the United States. A general
system of courts was created. Patrick Henry was elected the first Governor of
the Commonwealth of Virginia and he served from 1776 to 1779. The Commonwealth
of Virginia was now ready to function, and the new government went into
effect immediately. The Williamsburg Convention which began May 6, 1776
adjourned on July 5, 1776.</p>

<p>While this convention was in session, the Second Continental Congress was
meeting at the State House, now called Independence Hall, in Philadelphia. On
June 7, 1776 Richard Henry Lee, a Virginian, introduced a resolution "that these
United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that
they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political
convention between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be,
totally dissolved." The motion was seconded and urged strongly by John Adams
of Massachusetts. The usual discussion and argumentation period followed, and it
became obvious that six states hesitated to vote favorably for the resolution at this
time. Consequently, the official voting was postponed for three weeks, but Lee's
resolution was adopted by the Congress on July 2, 1776. However, a committee
of five was selected on June 10 to draw up a declaration of independence: Thomas
Jefferson (Virginia), Benjamin Franklin (Pennsylvania), John Adams (Massachusetts),
Roger Sherman (Connecticut) and Robert H. Livingston (New
York). Although Thomas Jefferson was one of the youngest Continental Congressmen,
he was selected as the chairman of this committee. Since only a few
deletions in the original plan drawn up by Jefferson were made by the other
members of the committee, the writing of the formal Declaration of Independence
is justly attributable to Thomas Jefferson, the Virginian. This Declaration of
Independence coupled with his "A Summary View of the Rights of British
America" later earned for Thomas Jefferson the title "The Pen of the Revolution."</p>

<p>The logical, thorough reasoning behind the content of the Declaration is easily
apparent. The first part of this document describes the nature and the purpose of
a government and the belief that a people have the right to change their government
when it no longer fulfills the purpose for which it was created. Then Jefferson
enumerated the various acts of the King and of the British Parliament which
the American colonists considered most unfair and contrary to the purpose of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
original founding of the colonies, as justification for their desire to change their
type of government. The next section reaches a conclusion from the previous two
sections: namely, that the colonists are renouncing their allegiance to the King
and are declaring that "these colonies are, and of right ought to be, Free and
Independent States."</p>

<p>On July 4, 1776 twelve states had voted for the adoption of the Declaration of
Independence. The thirteenth one, New York, accepted it on July 9. On July 19,
a resolution was adopted by the Second Continental Congress to have the July 4
Declaration engrossed on parchment entitled "The unanimous Declaration of the
thirteen United States of America" and, upon its completion, to have it signed
by each member. Fifty of the fifty-six members signed the official document by
August 2, and, of the remaining six signers, two were Virginians: George Wythe
who signed it later in August and Richard Henry Lee who signed it in September.
The seven Virginia delegates who signed the Declaration of Independence were
Carter Braxton (farmer), Benjamin Harrison (farmer), Thomas Jefferson (lawyer),
Richard Henry Lee (farmer), Francis Lightfoot Lee (farmer), Thomas
Nelson, Jr. (soldier) and George Wythe (lawyer).</p>

<p>After Richard Henry Lee had introduced his independence resolution, he proposed
another one suggesting that a permanent central government be created for
the new United States. A committee was appointed to draw up such a plan and,
in 1777, it submitted the Articles of Confederation to Congress. From 1775 to
1781, the Continental Congress acted as the central governing body of the
United States.</p>

<p>After Lord Dunmore had bombarded Norfolk in January 1776, he went up
the Chesapeake Bay to Gwynn's Island, near the present-day Mathews County
mainland. With about 500 men he set up a camp there in May 1776. General
Andrew Lewis, whom he had fought previously along the Ohio River, encamped
with a small Virginia army on the shore opposite the island on July 8. Although
it was very difficult to plant the cannon on the sandy shores, the next day General
Lewis and his troops fired upon the camp and the fleet and badly damaged many
of the ships. However, when his men invaded the island on the next day, they
found it evacuated. Lord Dunmore had sailed away from Virginia taking with
him the last governorship endowed with royal power. Thus, the Battle of Gwynn's
Island or Cricket Hill was famous because of its effect of driving the last royal
Governor from Virginia. It was, in a sense, ironic that Patrick Henry, who had
been detested by Lord Dunmore while Dunmore was Governor of Virginia,
became the first elected Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>During the governorship of Patrick Henry, population growth was again apparent
by the formation of eight new counties in 1777-1778. These counties were:
Montgomery (formed from Fincastle County and, later, parts of Botetourt and
Pulaski and named for General Richard Montgomery&mdash;an American Revolutionary
officer), Fluvanna (formed from Albemarle County and named for Queen
Ann), Washington (formed from Fincastle County and, later, parts of Montgomery,
named for George Washington and having the distinction of being the
first locality in the United States so named), Powhatan (formed from Cumberland
County and named for Powhatan, the father of Pocahontas), Rockbridge
(formed from Augusta and Botetourt Counties and named in honor of the Natural
Bridge&mdash;a natural wonder of Virginia), Rockingham (formed from Augusta
County and believed named for the Marquis of Rockingham, England's Prime
Minister), Shenandoah (originally, Dunmore County and named for the Indian-named
Shenandoah River which translated means "Beautiful Daughter of the
Stars") and Henry (formed from Pittsylvania County and named in honor of
Patrick Henry).</p>

<p>George Rogers Clark, an older brother of William Clark of the well-known
Lewis and Clark expedition, had explored and had surveyed much of the territory
south of the Ohio River in the area now called Kentucky: at this time, it was the
western part of Fincastle County. He believed that this section was ready to
become an independent county and felt that, under such political status, the
settlers could better organize and protect themselves. Only the Virginia Assembly
could authorize the formation of this new county in 1776. Clark, therefore, called
the settlers together, explained his objective for Kentucky and succeeded in getting
John Gabriel Jones and himself elected as delegates to make a personal visit to the
Virginia General Assembly at Williamsburg. The trip was long, difficult and
dangerous, and to their dismay, the Assembly had already adjourned before they
arrived. Being a determined individual, however, Clark decided to talk to the
newly elected Governor, Patrick Henry, at his home. Hence, he traveled to Hanover
County, discussed his problem with the Governor and sought permission to
fight the Indians of the Kentucky area and to secure powder for the settlers'
muskets. His trip was successful and, on December 7, 1776, the western part of
Fincastle County was authorized to become the County of Kentucky in Virginia.</p>

<p>The British had been helping and encouraging Indian raids at this time in
Kentucky, along the border settlements of Virginia and in the Illinois area. Clark
believed that the Illinois area rightfully belonged to Virginia and felt that it must
be conquered in order to attain peace for the Virginia settlers. The reports of
official observers convinced him that this land could be invaded and captured with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
little effort. He returned to Williamsburg to get Governor Henry's approval for
this objective and was happy to be commissioned to raise several companies of
soldiers to be used in the invasion of the Illinois territory. Clark obtained his
troops, and, after traveling north through Virginia and then westward to the Ohio
River, they floated down the Ohio River on rafts and in boats. They landed near
Louisville on the northern bank of the Ohio and marched westward approximately
two hundred miles to Fort Kaskaskia. On July 4, 1778, they captured Fort Kaskaskia
and its leader, Colonel Henry Hamilton. Marching another 150 miles
northeastward, on February 25, 1779 they captured Fort Vincennes on the banks
of the Wabash River. The post of Cahokia was also captured. In honor of his
great bravery and extremely difficult marching, Clark was entitled the "Hannibal
of the West." This entire area was known as the Northwest Territory, and these
conquests of Clark and his troops gave Virginia complete claim for the control of
this area as part of the Virginia state at the end of the American Revolution in
1783. Without such conquests, England would undoubtedly have held this territory
after the Revolution, and it would probably have been an important part of
Canada today. Simultaneously, the capture of these forts reduced the danger of
Indian attacks considerably.</p>

<p>When the city of Philadelphia was about to be occupied by British troops on
September 18, 1777, the famous Liberty Bell was taken from the State House in
Pennsylvania for safekeeping. It was camouflaged with the heavy baggage of the
American army in a supply train of 700 wagons and was carefully guarded by
two hundred Virginian and North Carolinian cavalry-mounted troops. It was
hidden in the Zion Church in Allen town, Pennsylvania, until June 27, 1778
when it was returned to its tower in Independence Hall.</p>

<p>During the same month and year, Henry Lee, a native of Westmoreland
County, Virginia, who had been a captain in Colonel Thomas Bland's legion of
Virginia cavalry, joined Washington's army in Pennsylvania. His personal
achievements were many in this assignment and his excessive courage was noted
by Washington. He was soon promoted to major and was given special command
of three troops of horsemen plus an infantry company. He became a great annoyance
to the British while they were on the march as well as in camp. This comparatively
small group became so distinguished that they earned the tide of "Lee's
Legion" and Henry Lee was nicknamed "Light Horse Harry" Lee. He later
captured an important British post at Paulus Hook, New Jersey, and fought diligently
also in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. He was awarded
a gold medal by the Continental Congress for his brilliant cavalry exploits during
the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 9, 1779, a Britisher, General George Collier, arrived at Hampton
Roads with approximately 2,000 troops. They used Portsmouth as a base and after
making several raids in that area, destroyed not only the American navy yard at
Portsmouth (called Gosport at this time) but also large supply deposits stored
there. After awaiting reinforcements from General Henry Clinton in New York,
they decided to abandon Virginia because they believed a Virginia blockade had
prevented these reinforcements from arriving. Upon their departure, the inhabitants
of Virginia were once more able to carry on necessary and important trade
with the West Indies.</p>

<p>During this same year, a most unusual naval feat occurred in the Revolutionary
War. John Paul Jones was in command of an American ship called the "Bonhomme
Richard" off the coast of England when he spotted a British warship, the
"Serapis." After fierce fighting between the two ships, although his own ship
sank, he captured the "Serapis" and sailed away in it. Virginia had the honor of
providing the greatest naval hero of the Revolutionary War, John Paul Jones.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson was the second elected Governor of the Commonwealth of
Virginia. He held this office during most of the Revolutionary War Period. In
addition to peace and military warfare, Jefferson had personal interest in religion
and in education. In 1779, he wrote a proposed "Statute of Virginia for Religious
Freedom." He believed that the State Constitution had not included practical
religious liberty although the theory of religious freedom had been guaranteed.
Jefferson's proposal was finally passed by the General Assembly of Virginia in
1785. It is considered as one of the greatest Virginia documents because it guaranteed
religious freedom to all.</p>

<p>While serving as Governor, Jefferson proposed a plan for education called "A
Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge." He based this plan upon the
premise that democracy would be more successful if greater numbers of individuals
were educated. The plan was an attempt on his part to encourage the establishment
of free public schools for the children of the wealthy and the poor alike.
This proposal suggested three years of free elementary schooling for all children
regardless of their social or financial condition, free secondary education for those
individuals who were mentally equipped to gain from this experience and free
higher education for those who had displayed above average scholastic qualifications.
The bill was not passed, but it resulted in a consideration of the possibility
of public education at this time. Another example of Jefferson's enthusiastic
interest in education was his personal establishment, in 1779, of a chair of law
at William and Mary College in honor of a former teacher, a great lawyer and
a personal friend, George Wythe. As a result, George Wythe had the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of being the first professor of law in the United States in the first law school in
America.</p>

<p>While Jefferson was still Governor, the capital was moved in 1780 from
Williamsburg to Richmond in an effort to escape the invading British soldiers
and to provide a safer place of protection for the future. Lord Cornwallis, at this
time, was proceeding with his plans to move north through the Carolinas to
Virginia. Cornwallis had had a great victory at Camden, South Carolina, and
had decided to persuade many of the western mountain people to fight on behalf
of the British. Americans who favored the British in this revolution were called
"Tories" and those who favored the Americans were called "Patriots."</p>

<p>Cornwallis sent Major Patrick Ferguson and approximately a thousand Tories
to threaten these mountain folk in North Carolina and Southwest Virginia to the
extent of marching over their land, causing destruction and hanging their leaders
unless they discontinued their past resistance to the British army. Two American
military frontiersmen, Colonel John Sevier and Colonel Isaac Shelby, decided to
organize a group of riflemen and attack Ferguson before he had the opportunity
to cross the mountains and attack them. They contacted Colonel William Campbell
whose duty had been to protect the lead mines in Wythe County whose
resources were being mined and smelted for equipment for the American soldiers.
Colonel Campbell was invited to join Colonel Sevier and Colonel Shelby in their
attack against Ferguson. He accepted and later was selected by the officers as
their commander. Ferguson heard of their plan and selected a wooded mountain
ridge on the border between North Carolina and South Carolina, called King's
Mountain, for his battlefield. Ferguson's troops far outnumbered Colonel Campbell's
troops and were much better equipped with military supplies. Colonel
Campbell's troops, however, defeated the British badly on October 7, 1780.
Major Ferguson and two hundred other Britishers were killed in battle. This
Battle of King's Mountain is often called the turning point of the Revolutionary
War in the South because not only did it upset the military strategy of Cornwallis
but it also encouraged the southern patriots at a time when the morale had been
low. Colonel Campbell was promoted to a Brigadier-General as a direct result
of this battle. The British in the meantime had sent General Alexander Leslie
to Portsmouth with approximately 3,000 troops. After the severe British defeat
at King's Mountain, he left Portsmouth and headed his troops south to join
Cornwallis.</p>

<p>Morale in Virginia at this time was very low because there was a great shortage
of clothing, military equipment and supplies, there was a lack of money in the
state treasury, Virginia soldiers were fighting outside their state and British soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in large numbers were stationed in eastern and central Virginia. General William
Phillips and Cornwallis had seized and destroyed property valued at ten million
dollars in eastern Virginia alone by the spring of 1781.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, by March 1, 1781, the Articles of Confederation had been ratified
by all the states and thereby became the basis for the central government of the
United States. Since Maryland had refused to ratify the Articles until the states
which owned large western land-holdings would cede them to the central government,
Virginia, following a pattern of New York State, surrendered most of its
large holding claims in 1784. By this action, Virginia ceded the Northwest Territory
to the new nation, the United States. The entire region beyond the Ohio
River (now comprising the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin)
had rightfully been claimed by Virginia and cession to the United States
for the beginning of its public domain was a most generous gesture on the part
of Virginia. This action played an important part in creating a stronger feeling
of unity on the part of the thirteen original colonies and in giving Virginia
another nickname, "Mother of States."</p>

<p>The Confederation Congress was later faced with the problem of raising revenue
for the new government under the Articles of Confederation and for payment
of debts caused by the Revolutionary War. The Northwest Territory which
Virginia had ceded to the central government had become part of the national
domain, public lands of the United States. Congress decided to sell some of this
land to obtain necessary revenue. It passed the Land Ordinances of 1785 and
1787, which became practically the written bases for the rest of the frontier settlements.
The plan which was the forerunner of these ordinances concerning the
public domain was proposed by Thomas Jefferson and enacted on April 23, 1784.
In his plan, he outlined the territorial status preceding statehood and originated
the idea of dividing the public domain into districts before statehood could be
achieved. Two years later, the Confederation Congress gave a grant of 150,000
acres of land to George Rogers Clark and his followers as a reward for their great
services in conquering the Northwest Territory and in establishing the only legal
claim to this land on behalf of the United States. Virginia also reserved the
ownership of 6,000 square miles of land called the Virginia Military District
(presently located in the southern part of Ohio).</p>

<p>While General William Nelson, commander of the Virginia forces, was recruiting
additional militia in the counties near the coast, twenty-seven British ships
entered the Chesapeake Bay and headed for the mouth of the James River. Since
Governor Jefferson believed Richmond was not militarily prepared for such an
attack, he had the only five brass cannon of the capital city thrown into the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and had the remaining arms and ammunition taken seven miles from Richmond
to Westham. On July 4, the Governor evacuated from Richmond and most of
the inhabitants did likewise. On the next afternoon, General Benedict Arnold,
the American traitor who had joined the British forces, accompanied by nine
hundred British soldiers captured and burned Richmond unopposed. For two
days the British burned and destroyed public and private property and later returned
leisurely to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Subsequently, as some of the British vessels attempted to sail up the Appomattox
River, General Smallwood accompanied by three hundred American
soldiers armed only with muskets attacked the British fiercely and drove them
down the river. A short time later, General William Phillips brought additional
British troops to combine with those of Arnold and took command over General
Arnold. The combined forces marched first to Petersburg and then to Manchester
(now, South Richmond). Lafayette had been placed in charge of the defense
of Virginia at this time and he arrived in Richmond two days after Phillips had
arrived. When General Phillips heard that Lafayette was in Richmond, he changed
his mind and decided not to attack this city. In the meantime, Colonel Simcoe
had been sent by General Arnold to Westham where he destroyed the military
stores and the foundry. During this same period, General Phillips had sent
General Arnold to Chesterfield Court House where he destroyed the barracks and
burned the flour as they had previously burned the tobacco at Petersburg. As
General Phillips was proceeding down the James River towards Chesapeake Bay,
he received a message from General Cornwallis ordering him to meet with his
forces at Petersburg so Phillips returned to Petersburg. Four days after he had
arrived, General Phillips died of a fever in Petersburg and General Arnold succeeded
to the command once more.</p>

<p>General Arnold, however, realized the hatred of the Virginians toward him
for the burning and destruction for which he was responsible in Richmond.
Consequently, after his army had united with Cornwallis' troops at Petersburg,
he asked for a transfer to New York. Cornwallis, who disliked Arnold himself,
granted the request. When Lafayette was informed of the tremendous number of
British soldiers massed in Petersburg, he realized that it would be futile for his
comparatively small force of 3,000 men to try to combat them. Consequently, he
retreated slowly from Richmond towards Fredericksburg where he was joined by
General Anthony Wayne. Cornwallis who had expected to trap Lafayette and
his army was surprised by the orderly retreat and decided not to attack Richmond
again as the legislature had already withdrawn to Charlottesville. On May 10,
1781, as the British neared Richmond, Governor Jefferson had ordered the General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Assembly, which was then in session, to leave Richmond and continue the
session at Charlottesville on May 24. Thus, Charlottesville for a brief time was
the official capital of Virginia. Governor Jefferson's home, Monticello, was used
as a guest house for many of Jefferson's legislative friends. Cornwallis decided to
capture Jefferson who was at his home at Monticello, approximately three miles
from Charlottesville, to seize the legislators at Charlottesville and to destroy a
large quantity of military stores at a place called Point-of-Fork (at the junction
of the Rivanna and James Rivers). Cornwallis believed that such a plan, if
successfully carried out, would result in the complete surrender of the State of
Virginia. Therefore, Cornwallis divided his cavalry into two groups: one commanded
by Colonel John G. Simcoe who was to proceed to Point-of-Fork and the
other commanded by Colonel Banastre Tarleton who was to proceed to Charlottesville,
approximately seventy miles from his headquarters. After accomplishing
these objectives, Tarleton was to continue to Point-of-Fork and help Colonel
Simcoe.</p>

<p>General Baron Von Steuben heard about Simcoe's plan and was able to have
all the military stores hauled across the river before his arrival. Simcoe, however,
used military strategy in this instance which worked most successfully: he had
his men spread out, cut down trees and build large camp-fires at great distances
apart thus giving the impression that all of Cornwallis' army was on this campaign.
General Steuben observing the large radius of camp concluded that Cornwallis'
entire force was across the river. Consequently, he had his lighter baggage moved
and had his troops evacuate the area. Simcoe destroyed all the heavy baggage
and military stores and returned successfully to Cornwallis the next morning.</p>

<p>The British soldiers under Colonel Tarleton stopped for refreshments in Louisa
County at a place called Cuckoo Tavern. The tavern keeper had an American
soldier son, Captain Jack Jouett of the Virginia Militia, who happened to be at
the tavern but out of sight of tavern visitors on that particular Sunday afternoon.
He observed the two hundred and fifty British soldiers, overheard some of their
personal conversations and their casual references to their military mission. He
waited until the British had departed from the tavern and then he traveled on
horseback over a different road&mdash;forty miles of brush and thicket, field and
forest, vines and brambles. He rode without delay although the scars of some of
the branches which struck him in the face as he was riding so rapidly became
permanent ones. He believed that the British would probably make another stop
for refreshments at the home of Dr. William Walker, the only one in the vicinity.
Thus, he took time out to warn them of Tarleton's plans and to urge them to
delay the British as long as possible. Jouett reached Monticello at dawn, roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the inhabitants within and informed them of Tarleton's plan. Jefferson and his
guests fled on horseback and Mrs. Jefferson and their three children escaped to
a neighbor's house by carriage. As the British rode up one side of the steep hill
of Monticello, the Governor and his friends reached the bottom of the hill on
the other side. Jouett then safely led the Governor's party via a secluded road to
Staunton, which became another temporary capital. In the meantime, Tarleton
had tarried before coming to Monticello to burn a wagon train filled with Continental
Army supplies and had stopped as predicted at Castle Hill, the home of
the Walkers. Mrs. Walker fed the soldiers before the officers, thus causing an
added delay in their departure. Jack Jouett can be truly classified as the "Paul
Revere of the South." The Assembly members were so appreciative of the courage
and perseverance of Jouett that they subsequently presented him with a sword
and a pair of pistols.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1781, General Cornwallis and his troops left Williamsburg, fought
an inconsequential battle at Greenspring (near Jamestown) and then crossed
the James River to Portsmouth where he proceeded to Yorktown. By September
1781, he had approximately eight thousand soldiers garrisoned on the peninsula
at Yorktown. He had selected this site because he thought it was a secure one:
the Chesapeake Bay was on the east, the York River on the north and the James
River on the south. Actually, he had placed his soldiers in a most penetrable trap.</p>

<p>Marquis de Lafayette played an important part in the Revolutionary War. An
outstanding example of foreign help received by the Americans, Lafayette had
volunteered at the age of nineteen to serve in the American Army in 1777. After
arriving from France in North Carolina, he rode horseback to Philadelphia to
appear personally before the Continental Congress to offer his services to the
American colonies. He had been appointed a Major-General by Congress and
had been placed on Washington's staff. He had fought in the Battle of Brandywine
Creek (Pennsylvania) and had been seriously wounded. His outstanding
bravery had been recognized by Washington and they had begun a strong friendship
which was to continue throughout their lives. He had endured with Washington
the terrible winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania (1777-1778) and acted
as a morale builder to Washington's disheartened forces. He had been the hero
at the Battle of Monmouth, New Jersey. After France had officially recognized
the independence of the United States, Lafayette had returned to France, and,
after encouraging many French soldiers to help the Americans fight, he had
rejoined Washington. In 1781, Washington had sent him to defend and protect
Virginia where he had cleverly pursued Cornwallis from near Charlottesville to
Yorktown. After his role in the final strategy of Yorktown defense and his return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to France, one can understand why Virginians consider Lafayette one of their
heroes and have a famous bust of him created by the great sculptor, Jean Antoine
Houdon, located in the rotunda of the State Capitol Building in Richmond.</p>

<p>As soon as Lafayette had noticed Cornwallis gathering his troops at Yorktown,
he realized the possibility of surrounding Cornwallis and his forces since Lafayette
was so well acquainted with this terrain. He immediately informed Washington
of this situation and Washington quickly headed for his home state. In the
meantime, General Lafayette surrounded Cornwallis and his troops on the south
and on the west. Simultaneously, a fleet of twenty-five French warships from
the West Indies under command of Admiral de Grasse sailed up the Chesapeake
Bay with 3,000 French troops. This movement prevented Cornwallis from either
receiving British enforcements or from escaping out to sea. General Washington,
after feigning an attack against General Henry Clinton in New York, rapidly
moved his army southward, joined with the forces of General Count de Rochambeau.
Washington soon attacked the British on the north and on the west. Although
Cornwallis realized that he was completely surrounded by American and
French forces, he and his troops fought valiantly for weeks.</p>

<p>The home of General Thomas Nelson, the Governor of Virginia at this time,
was located in Yorktown. General Cornwallis had taken possession of this house
for his headquarters at Yorktown. Out of deference to the Governor, the American
soldiers had refrained from firing upon it. However, General Nelson ordered
them to fire upon the house, regardless of its sentimental value, because it housed
British officers. The first shot killed two British officers and a cannon ball still
embedded in one wall may be observed today in the Nelson House at Yorktown.</p>

<p>Finally recognizing the futility of fighting any longer, on October 17, 1781,
General Cornwallis requested a parley, ordered a cease firing, and exchanged
messages with Washington. At two o'clock of the next afternoon, Cornwallis
selected the Moore House in Yorktown for a discussion of surrender terms: this
house was out of range of the firing and conveniently located. The British, the
French and the Americans sent representatives for the consultation, John Laurens
representing the Americans. After long discussion and debate, the articles of
capitulation were agreed upon and the generals signed them the next day. At
twelve o'clock on October 19, 1781, the British signing was done by General Cornwallis
and Thomas Symonds, the American signing by General Washington, and
the French signing by General Rochambeau and Count de Barras for Count de
Grasse. On October 19, at 2 p.m., as agreed upon by the surrender terms, the
British army of 7,000 troops left Yorktown and laid down their arms at Surrender
Field, just south of the town. They marched between two long lines of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
on one side and the Americans on the other side. General Charles O'Hara, the
leader of the British, apologized to Washington for the non-appearance of Lord
Cornwallis who was reported ill. The Battle of Yorktown ended the Revolutionary
War although the peace treaty was not signed until 1783.</p>

<p>In this same year, the American army was demobilized. George Washington
bade farewell to his officers at Fraunces' Tavern, New York City, on December 4,
resigned on December 23 and returned to Mt. Vernon to retire. Already he had
won the admiration of the new nation for his continued courage, bravery and
great military strategy so ably exemplified during the American Revolutionary
War. He also had earned the well-deserved title: "The Sword of the Revolution."</p>


<h3><em>The Adoption of the United States and State Constitutions</em></h3>

<p>By 1785, the Americans began to realize that the Articles of Confederation
were too weak to become effective. The central government did not have sufficient
political power to govern, the lack of a single executive resulted in a lack of
leadership, the Confederation Congress could make laws but had no power to
enforce them, the Congress could issue paper money and coins but had no power
to buy gold and silver for backing this money and the Congress could levy taxes
but had no power to collect them. There was no provision for a national court
system. In order to pass a law, nine states had to agree in its favor; in order to
amend the Articles, all thirteen states had to agree. Under the Articles of Confederation,
the government was a confederacy in which each state retained its
own political authority and the central government was responsible to the states.
The control of foreign and interstate commerce was left entirely to the individual
states. Chaos and confusion resulted. Consequently, in 1785, George Washington
invited some representatives from Maryland and from Virginia to meet with
him to discuss the problem of a stronger central government and to settle a
dispute which had arisen concerning the navigation of the Potomac River.</p>

<p>The conference started at the City Tavern (later known as Gadsby's Tavern)
in Alexandria and was later continued at Mount Vernon, home of Washington.
During the discussion, Washington stated that there should be a common money
system for all the states as well as a common plan for regulating domestic and
foreign commerce. James Madison was one of the Virginians present, and he felt
that there must be other problems of common interest to all the states. Therefore,
when the next General Assembly met in January 1786, Madison proposed that
representatives from all the states should meet at Annapolis, Maryland on September
11, 1786 to discuss trade problems and other areas of mutual interest.
The Virginia legislature, therefore, invited all the states to send representatives to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Annapolis to attempt to formulate a uniform currency and commerce system for
all the states.</p>

<p>In September 1786, only five states sent delegates to the Annapolis meeting:
Virginia, Delaware, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. These delegates,
nevertheless, suggested that a convention be held on May 25, 1787 at the State
House in Philadelphia for the purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.
After this recommendation had been submitted to the Confederation Congress,
it hesitatingly invited all the states to meet the next year at Philadelphia. Virginia
sent seven delegates to this Philadelphia convention: George Washington,
John Blair, James Madison, George Mason, James McClurg, Edmund Randolph
(Governor at this time) and George Wythe.</p>

<p>Seventy-three individuals had been chosen as delegates from the twelve states,
but only fifty-six members were present at the convention. All the states were
represented at the convention except Rhode Island. When the convention began
on May 25, 1787, George Washington was unanimously chosen President of the
convention to preside over the meetings and rules of procedure were adopted. It
is significant to note the absence of three of the Virginia Revolutionary Period
leaders: Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. Lee declined
membership because he believed that, since he was a member of the Confederation
Congress and since he thought the revised Articles would be submitted to this
Congress for approval, he should not become a member of the Convention to revise
the same and, subsequently, be a member of the Confederation Congress which
would be asked to pass upon the revised plan. Jefferson was the United States
Minister to France at this time and was out of the country. Although Patrick
Henry had been elected as a delegate to the convention, he had refused to accept
the assignment because he was skeptical about governmental changes which the
convention might make. Two Virginians who were present made written comments
concerning the type of individuals who represented their states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) George Mason (in a letter to his son)&mdash;"America has certainly, upon
this occasion, drawn forth her first characters.... The eyes of the U. S. are
turned upon this assembly, and their expectations raised to a very anxious
degree." Mason's personal attitude toward the responsibility of being a state
delegate at this convention is summarized in this remark: "I would not serve
upon pecuniary reasons alone in this convention for a thousand pounds a day."</p>

<p>(2) James Madison&mdash;"It contains in several instances the most respectable
characters in the U. S., and in general may be said to be the best contribution
of talents the States could make for the occasion."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The meetings were held secretly behind closed doors because of the grave
problems which the convention had to solve. After the delegates began to discuss
the necessary changes which had to be made, they realized the impossibility of
simply revising the Articles of Confederation and the absolute necessity of writing
a new constitution which would make the central government a much stronger
political power. James Madison, a most profound student of government, is considered
as the most influential member of the convention. He was the most active
speaker at the convention and he kept careful notes of the entire session. Madison
is regarded as the "Father of the United States Constitution."</p>

<p>One of the first questions to be decided at the convention was the type of
organization of the government. Governor Edmund Randolph presented Madison's
"Virginia" Plan recommending a strong, central government and one in
which each state would be represented in proportion to its population. This plan
is sometimes referred to as the "Large State" Plan because most of the larger
states favored it: according to this plan, the more population a state had, the
greater the representation. The small states had their plan also: it was presented
by William Paterson of New Jersey and is known as the "Paterson" or "New
Jersey" or "Small State" Plan. The small states favored states' rights rather than
a strong, central government and believed that each state should be represented
equally regardless of its population. The "Great Compromise" which was finally
adopted was a combination of both plans: a bicameral legislature called Congress
was to be created consisting of (1) the House of Representatives with membership
from each state based upon the population of the state and (2) the Senate with
membership based upon equal representation from each state&mdash;two Senators from
each state. The plan of government finally adopted provided for a strong central
government but with the state governments retaining essential reserve powers.</p>

<p>After the Constitution had been completed on September 17, 1787, it was
submitted to the Confederation Congress with the recommendation that Congress
inform each state legislature about the Constitution and ask for state ratification.
The Constitutional requirement for making the document effective was ratification
by nine states. Washington was very eager for the Constitution of the United
States to be adopted. He wrote many personal letters favoring its adoption including
a public letter in which he reminded the states that each state must be willing
to make certain concessions for the benefits of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>Thirty-nine of the fifty-six delegates signed the Constitution. Only three of
the six delegates from Virginia signed it: George Washington, John Blair and
James Madison. Madison, in fact, was consulted for an opinion on almost every
phase of the Constitution. During the campaign period for and against ratification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Madison joined Alexander Hamilton and John Jay of New York and contributed
to a series of essays called "The Federalist." The essays included a discussion
of the meaning of the various provisions of the Constitution and attempted
to prove that the federal or central government would not misuse the power
granted to it. Madison wrote twenty of the eighty-five essays contained in "The
Federalist." This series of essays is believed to have influenced more people to
favor the adoption of the Constitution than any other written or oral effort.</p>

<p>The most influential writings against the adoption of the Constitution were
authored by Richard Henry Lee in his "Letters of a Federal Farmer." George
Mason and Edmund Randolph refused to sign the Constitution of the United
States because it contained no bill of rights, it did not provide either for the
immediate prohibition of slave traffic or for the eventual abolition of slavery and,
in their opinion, gave Congress too much control over navigation and tariff
policies. Edmund Randolph, Governor of Virginia and a delegate at the Philadelphia
Convention, played an unusual role: he did not sign the Constitution
himself because he did not approve of the final document but he did urge the
State of Virginia to accept it because he believed that a union of states was
necessary. James McClurg and George Wythe did not sign it because they were
absent, but they did encourage the ratification of the Constitution by Virginia.</p>

<p>On June 2, 1788, a Virginia State Convention was held in Richmond to determine
whether or not Virginia would accept the new Constitution of the United
States. There were one hundred and sixty-eight official delegates present, and
they elected Edmund Pendleton president of the convention. Sectionalism appeared
obvious in the state at this time: the Piedmont area and the southwest area
which did not have many slaves opposed ratification while the Tidewater area
and the northwest area favored the adoption of the Constitution. James Madison,
John Marshall (who actually explained much of the Constitution to the members
of the convention), Edmund Randolph, George Wythe and General "Light Horse
Harry" Lee spoke on behalf of the Constitution; George Mason, Patrick Henry,
Richard Henry Lee, James Monroe and William Grayson spoke very strongly
against it. The chief arguments against ratification were that the central government
had been given far too much power and the individual states far too little
power, that the commerce clause was too powerful and that the continuance of
the slave trade was permitted. Finally, after Madison had agreed to suggest and
to urge adoption of many amendments, the Virginia convention ratified the
Constitution of the United States by the close vote of 89 to 79 on June 26, 1788.
It is interesting to note that, at this time, the State of Virginia included the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
area of Virginia and the area now included in the States of Kentucky and of
West Virginia.</p>

<p>The State of Virginia missed by five days the honor of being the necessary
ninth state to ratify the Constitution, New Hampshire having this honor. As
Virginia became the tenth state to ratify it, the following declaration was officially
recorded: "We, the Delegates of the People of Virginia, ... Do, in the name and
in behalf of the People of Virginia, declare and make known, that the powers
granted under the Constitution, being derived from the People of the United
States, may be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their
injury or oppression, and that every power not granted thereby remains with them
and at their Will; that therefore no right of any denomination can be canceled,
abridged, restrained, or modified by the Congress ... or any department or
Officer of the United States, except in those instances in which power is given
by the Constitution for those purposes: and that, among other essential rights,
the liberty of Conscience and of the press cannot be canceled, abridged, restrained
or modified by any Authority of the United States." This declaration expressed
fear on the part of Virginians concerning the new Constitution. At the same
time, the members of the Virginia convention proposed forty amendments which
became the bases of the ten amendments of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution
of the United States: James Madison introduced the first nine amendments and
Richard Henry Lee, the tenth amendment, to the Constitution of the United
States&mdash;all eventually adopted in 1791.</p>

<p>Between 1783 and 1789, on the domestic scene, Virginia had gained five new
counties: Campbell (formed from Bedford County and named for General William
H. Campbell, the hero of the Battle of King's Mountain), Greensville
(formed from Brunswick County and, later, parts of Sussex County and named
for General Nathaniel Greene or Sir Richard Grenville), Franklin (formed from
Bedford and Henry Counties and, later, parts of Patrick and named for Benjamin
Franklin), Russell (formed from Washington County and named for General
William Russell, a military hero also at the Battle of King's Mountain in the
Revolutionary War) and Nottoway (formed from Amelia County and named for
an Indian tribe, "Nottoway"&mdash;the word meaning "snake or enemy"). Two years
later, Patrick County was formed from Henry County and was named in honor of
the patriot, Patrick Henry.</p>

<p>Another domestic problem during this period concerned the boundary dispute
between Pennsylvania and Virginia. When the Penns colonized Pennsylvania,
they claimed the 39th degree parallel as their southern boundary. Virginia, however,
claimed all the territory as far north as the 40th degree parallel including the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
choice section of Fort Pitt (now the site of Pittsburgh). After Pennsylvania
authorities had established courts at Hanna's Town (now Greensburg), Governor
Dunmore of Virginia sent Dr. John Connelly to establish a rival court with
competing magistrates in 1773. The struggle for ownership of this area was temporarily
postponed during the American Revolution, although the Virginia courts
continued to remain in session in western Pennsylvania from 1774 to 1780.
Finally, negotiations took place, and an agreement was adopted to allow a survey
to be made in the region and to accept a boundary recommended by the joint
boundary commission. The Mason and Dixon Line was extended to the southwest
corner of Pennsylvania in 1784; the western boundary line of Pennsylvania was
permanently agreed upon in 1785-1786.</p>

<p>In the following year, in December, an historical event took place which contributed
greatly to science. James Rumsey, a native Marylander who had moved
to Bath, Virginia (now Berkeley Springs, West Virginia), was interested in boat-building
and in the possibility of steam propulsion. After the Virginia General
Assembly had given him exclusive permission to navigate specific types of boats
constructed by himself on the state waterways for ten years, he successfully transported
six individuals for the first time in a steamboat four miles up the Potomac
River near Shepherdstown. Rumsey continued to experiment with additional
steamboats on the Potomac. In order to obtain financial assistance, he traveled
subsequently to London and ironically died there before his second boat, the
"Columbia Maid," had been completely constructed. This event occurred twenty
years before Robert Fulton made his historic trip up the Hudson River in the
"Clermont."</p>

<p>By 1789 George Washington had retired to Mount Vernon and had become
a gentleman farmer at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. He was
overseeing his fields on horseback one day when a messenger arrived from New
York City informing him that his name had appeared unanimously on the ballot
of every elector, electing him as the first President of the United States&mdash;"The
Father of His Country." The American people still remembered his great leadership
qualities during the Revolutionary War and during the Constitutional Convention.
Thus, Washington was faced with a most difficult task: to make a new
government work successfully though it was practically only in outline form and
even though there was opposition and criticism awaiting the first President.
Washington was also informed that the new government was to begin operating
on March 4, 1789 and that Congress desired that he arrive in New York City for
his inauguration on that date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>It took the Congressmen themselves longer to arrive from their various states,
however, than they had expected. John Adams, the Vice-President, did not arrive
until April 22 from Massachusetts to take his oath of office. Washington had
much farther to travel than did John Adams and had many preparations to make
before leaving Mount Vernon. He visited Fredericksburg to bid his mother farewell
and traveled via stagecoach through Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania
to New York. Roads were in poor condition making traveling very slow and
Washington was such a prominent figure that he was stopped along the way by
his old friends, especially in New Jersey. One significant incident was his welcome
at Trenton, New Jersey, part of which consisted of a presentation of flowers
by thirteen young ladies dressed in white, symbolic of the thirteen stars of the
flag of the United States and of the thirteen states that had honored him by
electing him to the Presidency. When he arrived at the New York ferry, thirteen
sailors in red, white and blue uniforms were waiting to row him across the Hudson
River to New York City. On April 30, 1789, Washington took his official oath
of office in Federal Hall as the first President of the United States. A marble
statue stands today on the spot on Wall Street where this event took place. New
York became the first capital city of the United States. Since the capital was
changed to Philadelphia in the following year, Washington was the only President
of the United States to be inaugurated in New York City.</p>


<h3><em>State and National Events (1789-1860)</em></h3>

<p>Since Washington was a strong believer in the Constitution of the United
States and had put forth much effort in getting it ratified, he tried conscientiously
to set up a government satisfactory to all Americans. He wisely used his talent
of recognizing individuals with a particular skill when he selected his first cabinet
to advise him: Thomas Jefferson (Virginia), Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Alexander
Hamilton (New York), Secretary of the Treasury, and Henry Knox
(Massachusetts), Secretary of War. Edmund Randolph, a Virginian, was appointed
Attorney-General, but this office did not become a cabinet post until 1814.
The men holding these positions for the first time had a heavy responsibility in
deciding specifically the range of duties each position should include and in
properly carrying out these duties.</p>

<p>The practice of "log-rolling," defined as the "joining together of politicians to
mutually further each other's plans of activities," was followed at this early time of
our new government. The question had arisen in Congress whether or not Congress
should assume the state debts, most of which had been accumulated during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the Revolutionary War. The Congressmen who favored such assumption believed
that such action would not only tend to strengthen security and confidence
of the American people in their new government but would also make it easier
for the United States to borrow money, either at home or from a foreign country.
Since Virginia and many of the Southern States had already assumed and had
paid most of their debts, the Virginia legislature opposed this bill strongly in 1790
and believed that it placed an unjust hardship upon the State. This state legislative
objection was the first official action of a state against a federal bill. Since
the Northern States preferred a location in the north for the national capital,
Hamilton and Jefferson encouraged their friends to vote for each other's proposals.
Hamilton's friends in the north voted for locating the capital along the Potomac
in return for Jefferson's friends in the south voting for the assumption of state
debts by the national government.</p>

<p>There had been discussion for a long time about changing the location of the
national capital from New York City to a more central location along the Atlantic
seaboard. When a site along the Potomac River was finally agreed upon, Maryland
and Virginia agreed to cede part of its land for the establishment of a Federal
District to become the seat of government of the United States. On December 3,
1789, Virginia ceded thirty and three-quarters square miles of land including the
town of Alexandria and part of Fairfax County. The stone locating the original
southern corner boundary, officially laid by Dr. Elisha Cullen Dick, may still be
seen near Jones Point, Alexandria.</p>

<p>Early efforts to commercialize waterways materialized in 1790. One of the
earliest commercial canals built in either Virginia or in the United States as a
whole was the James River Canal. It was constructed by the James River Company,
and, although it was only seven miles in length, it connected Richmond
with Westham and was parallel to the James River. This marked the beginning
of the canal-building era in the United States.</p>

<p>An event which affected the United States and the State of Virginia occurred
in 1792 when Kentucky was admitted into the Union as the fifteenth state
(Vermont had entered as the fourteenth one in 1791). This action deprived the
State of Virginia of approximately 75,000 inhabitants, of 40,395 square miles of
territory and of nine counties. Kentucky was originally part of Fincastle County,
Virginia and later had gained status as an independent county in Virginia, called
Kentucky County. Virginia gave the necessary consent for the independence of
Kentucky, required before statehood could be granted. The boundaries of the
State of Virginia thereafter remained fixed from 1792 until 1861 when West
Virginia became a separate state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington, during his Presidency, showed his ability to lead in civilian affairs
as well as in military affairs. His diplomatic ability predominated in the torn
loyalty toward England and toward France when these nations fought each other
in 1793: he issued the Neutrality Proclamation whereby the United States would
take neither side in this conflict. Throughout his two terms, he created precedents
and made decisions of lasting value for the United States. Such a precedent was
his refusal to run for a third time as President of the United States, a precedent
which was not broken until 1940 when Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted the
nomination for the Presidency.</p>

<p>While Washington was President, the population of Virginia continued to
grow. Six new counties were created during this period: Wythe (formed from
Montgomery County with later additions from Montgomery and Grayson Counties
and named in honor of George Wythe, a Virginia signer of the Declaration
of Independence, a famous lawyer and the first Professor of Law in the United
States), Mathews (formed from Gloucester County and named for Major Thomas
Mathews of the Revolutionary War), Bath (formed from Augusta, Botetourt and
Greenbrier Counties and named because of the medicinal springs located in the
area), Grayson (formed from Wythe County and, later, additions from Patrick
County and named for Colonel William Grayson, a United States Senator from
Virginia), Lee (formed from Russell County and, later, additions from Scott
County and named for General Henry Lee, Governor of Virginia, as well as an
outstanding military leader), and Madison (formed from Culpeper County and
named for James Madison, a state legislator and member of the United States
House of Representatives during this period).</p>

<p>After John Adams had been elected to the Presidency in 1796, the Democratic-Republican
Party began to use the typical political method of attacking the party
in power, namely the Federalists, through newspaper articles and through written
pamphlets. Since many of the foreigners who had come to America at this time
were Democratic-Republican in their political beliefs, numerous articles criticizing
President John Adams and his administration were written by them. In order to
combat these political attacks, the Federalist leaders were responsible for getting
two most unusual laws passed: the Alien and Sedition Laws. The Alien Act
provided that the residence time required of foreigners for naturalization (the
process whereby a foreigner becomes a citizen) was to be fourteen years instead
of five years and that the President was henceforth authorized to imprison or
deport without trial foreigners whom he considered dangerous to the peace and
safety of the United States or to allow others to remain. The Sedition Act stated
that any person convicted of defaming, either by spoken or by written word, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
government of the United States or the President of the United States or the
Congress of the United States was subject to a fine of not more than $2,000 and
to imprisonment for not more than two years.</p>

<p>Several Federalists considered the passage of these laws unjust. Thomas Jefferson,
the Vice-President of the United States at the time of their passage, decided
to attract the attention of voters to the passage of such laws. He drew up resolutions
in 1789 which stated that: (1) the Alien and Sedition Laws were unconstitutional
because the President of the United States had no power to imprison
or deport any person without a judicial trial and because Congress did not have
the right to limit the freedom of speech and of press and (2) since the Union was
a compact of states and since the federal government had only the particular
powers granted to it by the states, each state had the right to decide the constitutionality
of Congressional laws. Because these resolutions were first introduced
into the Kentucky legislature, they were later called the Kentucky Resolutions.
At the same time, James Madison drew up similar resolutions which were introduced
into the Virginia Assembly. The Virginia Resolutions are significant since
they explain the theory of "strict construction" (that the federal government has
only those powers specifically delegated to it) and they illustrate the strong "states'
rights" feeling which existed in the State of Virginia. Virginia and Kentucky were
the only two states to openly protest the Alien and Sedition Acts. Many of the
northern states denied on this occasion the right of a state to judge a federal law.
They affirmed, on the contrary, the belief that only the federal courts can decide
the constitutionality of a federal law.</p>

<p>On December 14, 1799, George Washington died at Mount Vernon where
he had retired after his Presidency. His military genius and brilliant statesmanship
are probably best summarized in the "Funeral Oration upon President Washington"
by Henry Lee in his now-famous phrase: "First in War, First in Peace and
First in the Hearts of His Countrymen."</p>

<p>In 1800, Virginia was considered first among the sixteen states of the Union
(Vermont, Kentucky and Tennessee having been admitted into the Union before
1800) in wealth and in population: 447,800 whites and 359,777 Negroes. The
influence of Virginia in the political, economic and social life of the country was
a profound one. The majority of residents now consisted of "average" individuals
who regarded the democratic ideas of Thomas Jefferson as a basic philosophy for
everyday living. The polite courtesy and hospitality of the olden days still remained,
but many of the traditional, dignified ceremonies had become outmoded.
The descendants of the aristocratic planters of the early nineteenth century were
usually people of limited means and limited acreage because the war and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
aftermath had decreased much of their wealth. However, the typical Virginian
who could afford it still preferred to live in the country, own horses, dogs and fine
cattle, enjoy fox hunting and the social gatherings of friends, celebrate traditional
activities and understand and cherish the rich heritage which was theirs.</p>

<p>In 1800, Thomas Jefferson, a native of Shadwell, Virginia, was elected third
President of the United States. He was the first President to be inaugurated at
Washington, D. C. His ideas concerning government were so numerous and
thought-provoking that his political philosophy has been termed "Jeffersonian
Democracy." He had strong faith in the ability of the common man, believed
in government economy and practiced this belief throughout his administration.
He exhibited his broadmindedness by allowing many government officials of
opposite political party beliefs to retain their same positions after he became
President and he was a strong advocate of States' Rights. After Jefferson became
President, he appointed John Marshall of Germantown and Richmond as Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Marshall had been a member
of the state legislature, an outstanding lawyer, a Congressman and had served as
Secretary of State under President John Adams. John Marshall remained
Chief Justice for thirty-four years and holds the record for length of service on
the Supreme Court of the United States. He was personally responsible for
creating a strong foundation for the Supreme Court. Although he was the
second Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, it was during his judgeship that for
the first time, a Congressional law was declared unconstitutional in the case of
Marbury versus Madison. This decision greatly strengthened the theory of judicial
review of national legislation. It is interesting to note that John Marshall was as
strong a Federalist as his cousin, Thomas Jefferson, was a strong "States' Rights"
man.</p>

<p>While Jefferson as President was solving national problems, his home state was
solving problems, too. In August 1800, Virginia had its first organized slave
insurrection. Led by Gabriel, approximately one thousand slaves in the area
around Richmond decided to march on Richmond and massacre the white inhabitants
there. However, at the scheduled time for the march to begin, a severe
rainstorm delayed the march. During the delay, Pharaoh, one of the Negroes,
decided to warn the Richmonders of their impending disaster. In spite of the
heavy rains and the fact that it became necessary for him to swim certain swollen
streams without being caught by one of his own group, he continued to Richmond
and warned the authorities in time. He informed them of the proposed plan to
kill the male inhabitants, capture the women inhabitants, seize the public arms
and create a general slave insurrection. Consequently, the conspirators, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Gabriel, were caught, convicted and executed. The Virginia Assembly rewarded
Pharaoh for his courageous act by giving him complete freedom.</p>

<p>While the State of Virginia was increasing its counties, the United States was
beginning to expand beyond its original boundary established after the Revolutionary
War. President Jefferson had heard rumors that Spain had ceded Louisiana
back to France in secret diplomatic relations. If true, such a condition could
ruin American trade along the Mississippi River and could suggest a possibility
of a French empire in America. Jefferson decided to have the government of the
United States purchase the Island of Orleans, near the mouth of the Mississippi
River. After the United States Ambassador to France had been unable to purchase
only the Island of Orleans, Jefferson sent James Monroe, a native of Westmoreland
County, to assist the Ambassador. In 1803, the treaty making the
purchase of Louisiana, that vast area of land west of the Mississippi, official was
ratified by the United States. This purchase added 827,000 square miles to the
area of the land under the jurisdiction of the United States government at the
cost of $15,000,000.</p>

<p>President Jefferson was also very much interested in the Oregon Country. He
had made frequent attempts to have this region explored but all his attempts were
unsuccessful. However, after the purchase of Louisiana, he persuaded the federal
government to finance, by means of a $2500 appropriation, an official government
expedition to make the first overland route to the Pacific Ocean and to explore
the region which the United States had recently acquired. He selected Captain
Meriwether Lewis of Ivy, Virginia, to head this expedition and Lieutenant William
Clark, a very close Virginian friend of Lewis' to accompany him. Their group
left St. Louis in the spring of 1804, traveled up the Missouri River, spent a rigid
winter in an area now located in North Dakota, continued traveling up the
Missouri in the spring of 1805, crossed the Rocky Mountains, and built and
paddled canoes until they reached the mouth of the Columbia River in November,
1805. There they built a fort near the present site of Astoria. They remained
on the Pacific Coast during the winter and returned to St. Louis in 1806. Lewis
and Clark were aided considerably in their travel route directions by an Indian
woman guide, Sacajawea. This expedition to the Northwest furnished the best
claim of the United States in later ownership disputes with England.</p>

<p>Aaron Burr, long the political opponent of Alexander Hamilton, lived in Petersburg.
In 1807, Burr was accused of a conspiracy to invade Mexico, to snatch it
from Spanish control and to establish an independent Mexican government with
himself as the self-appointed ruler. Furthermore, he was accused of having laid
plans for setting up a government in the western territory of the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
with the objective of eventually organizing this area into a separate, independent
government with himself the self-appointed ruler. Burr was officially tried on a
charge of treason at the State Capitol Building in Richmond. Chief Justice John
Marshall was the presiding judge. Jefferson, who had disliked Burr for political
reasons for a long time and who believed that Burr was guilty of the aforementioned
treasonous actions, wanted Burr convicted. Although the trial involved
many political entanglements, Burr was finally acquitted.</p>

<p>During the same year, Virginia made national headlines again when the
"Leopard-Chesapeake" Affair took place. France and Britain had been having
personnel problems with their navy crews, each accusing the other of trying to
encourage desertions. Britain had sent a fleet over to Norfolk in an attempt to
intercept some French ships harbored in the Chesapeake Bay. One of the British
ships had its entire crew desert, and it was believed that they had dashed to
Norfolk and would be hiring out soon on a French or American ship. The British
captain of the fleet had been informed that these crew members supposedly had
enlisted on the "Chesapeake," a new American naval vessel. A British vessel, the
"Leopard," was ordered to search the "Chesapeake" outside the jurisdiction of the
United States. Consequently, the "Leopard" followed the "Chesapeake" out
beyond Cape Henry and then demanded that the "Chesapeake" be searched by
British officers. When the "Chesapeake," under the command of Commodore
James Barron, denied having any deserters and refused the right to search, the
"Leopard" approached very closely the "Chesapeake" and fired at it broadside.
Three Americans were killed, seventeen others wounded and four deserters were
surprisingly found aboard the "Chesapeake." Although many Americans clamored
for war as a result of this incident, Jefferson, who still preferred peace, retaliated
by having Congress pass the Embargo Act whereby no American ship could depart
for any foreign port. Jefferson believed the lack of American exports would cause
the countries of Europe to cease the practice of impressment of American seamen.
The Americans, however, suffered more from this act than did the French and
the British; eventually, it was repealed and a law was passed allowing American
vessels to trade with any country except England and France. By the end of
Jefferson's administration, nevertheless, the American people were very restless,
and in some sections of the country war was believed to be inevitable with England
or with France.</p>

<p>On March 4, 1809, Virginia had another one of her sons, James Madison,
inaugurated as President of the United States. He was born in Port Conway,
Virginia, and, after graduating from Princeton, he had fought in the Revolutionary
War. He had served in the state legislature, had been a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Second Continental Congress, had been a member of the Constitutional Convention
in Philadelphia where he had earned the title "Father of the Constitution of
the United States" and had contributed to the "Federalist" papers encouraging
the adoption of the Constitution. After serving in the United States House of
Representatives, he had retired from national politics and had centered his interest
upon state government functions. He had written the "Virginia Resolutions" and
had served as United States Secretary of State at the request of President Jefferson.
Therefore, he came to the Presidency well prepared to assume presidential
duties.</p>

<p>In contrast with his desire for peace, Madison held the office of President of
the United States during the War of 1812 with England. Only a few battles
were fought near Virginia in this war. The British had as one of their objectives
the capture of the City of Norfolk. George Cockburn, a British Admiral, entered
Chesapeake Bay with a fleet of approximately 1800 men, and they plundered
many plantations along the coast of Maryland and Virginia. An American ship,
the "U. S. S. Dolphin," was captured by the British ship, "St. Domingo," in the
Rappahannock River. A sea battle was later fought at Craney Island, located at
the entrance of Norfolk Harbor where American sailors, marines and militia men
were defending the small island. As the British rowed toward the island shore
on barges, heavy artillery fire sank many of the boats causing hundreds of the
Britishers to drown. The British subsequently withdrew and Norfolk escaped
serious damage. The British soon desired to attack Hampton. They successfully
pillaged the town and proceeded to the Carolinas. Several Virginians participated
in the War of 1812 and the students of Hampden-Sydney College, as in the
Revolutionary War, volunteered as an entire student body to fight for their
country.</p>

<p>Virginia became a famous place of refuge during the War of 1812. When the
British invaded Washington in August 1814, President Madison and his wife,
Dolly Madison, fled from the White House on August 24 to Salona, a house
located in Falls Church. It is believed that Dolly Madison crossed the Chain
Bridge over the Potomac River and traveled rapidly over the secondary roads until
she finally reached the house of Reverend and Mrs. William Maffitt. Dolly
Madison carried with her the Declaration of Independence and the famous portrait
of George Washington painted by Gilbert Stuart. Mrs. Maffitt quickly
admitted Dolly Madison, and the President himself and some of his cabinet members
arrived later with Reverend Maffitt. They could see the burning White
House from the Maffitt residence. Although the President had to depart shortly
afterwards, Dolly Madison stayed there for the duration of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>After his Presidency had ended, James Madison returned to Montpelier, the
family homestead near Orange, where he lived until his death in 1836.</p>

<p>While Madison was occupied with national affairs, there were several important
events happening in his home state. In 1809-1810, a Literary Fund for Virginia
was established as an aid to public education by providing money for school
expenses. The state legislature under the direction of Governor John Tyler, Sr.,
provided that "all escheats (land the title to which was reclaimed by the state),
confiscations, penalties and forfeitures, and all rights in personal property found
derelict (deserted or abandoned) should be appropriated to the encouragement
of learning." As time passed, this fund expanded considerably and was used to
improve elementary education. Only the most proficient students were allowed
to attend public secondary schools. The General Assembly encouraged the establishment
of classical schools and academies via revenue secured from lotteries.
In 1816, the Federal Government paid $1,210,550 to Virginia in return for a loan
granted to the Federal Government by Virginia for the defraying of expenses
incurred during the War of 1812. This payment was allotted to the Literary Fund.</p>

<p>From 1800 through 1816, the State of Virginia had four new counties formed:
Tazewell (formed from Wythe and Russell Counties and named for Henry Tazewell,
a United States Senator), Giles (created from Montgomery, Monroe and
Tazewell Counties and named for William Branch Giles, a Congressman from
Virginia who served four terms), Nelson (formed from Amherst County and
named for General Thomas Nelson, military leader and Governor of Virginia in
1781), and Scott (formed from Lee, Russell and Washington Counties and
named for General Winfield Scott, lawyer and military leader).</p>

<p>In 1811, Richmond suffered from a dreadful tragedy. Richmond had grown
in approximately twenty-five years from a village to a thriving city. As the capital
city of the state, it had become a center of wealth, social activities and entertainment.
The leading actors and actresses of the country played at the Richmond
Theater with pride. On the evening of December 26, 1811 as a play was in
progress, the scenery at the back of the stage caught fire. When an actor shouted
"The house is on fire!", chaos and confusion resulted. In addition to the flames
which rapidly roared through the theater, the panic and hysteria contributed to
the death of seventy-three individuals, including Governor George W. Smith and
many other distinguished citizens. Gilbert Hunt, a slave, is credited with saving
approximately twenty women and children by catching them as they were hurled
to safety from flaming windows. The doors of this theater had been constructed
in such a way that they only opened inwardly. Thus, when the audience madly
rushed for an exit, numerous individuals were crushed since the doors could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
be opened outwardly. As a result of this terrible tragedy, theater doors in Virginia
and in other states were constructed in the future to open outwardly from the
inside. A structure of stuccoed brick, known as Monumental Church, has been
built by the architect, Robert Mills, upon the site of the old theater, and on a
monument at the door is an inscription bearing the names of those who died in
this incident.</p>

<p>In 1816, thirty-five western counties of Virginia held a convention at Staunton
and demanded that the General Assembly be informed of their grievances and be
asked to adjust same. After the War of 1812, the western counties believed that
the State Constitution of 1776 was no longer appropriate and that the earlier
counties, in spite of their longer political experiences, were greatly over-represented
in proportion to their population as compared with the population of the
western counties. One particular criticism was the representation plan of membership
in the General Assembly. Although the white population was much greater
in number west of the Blue Ridge than in the east, the western counties had only
four delegates in the Assembly in comparison to thirteen delegates from the east.
Therefore, these convention delegates demanded a revised or new state constitution
which would include fair treatment, in their opinion, for the western counties
of Virginia. The Staunton convention of 1816 caused other residents of Virginia,
especially the politicians, to realize that this mountainous area was increasing in
population and in interest in state and in national affairs and that it expected a
similar increase in power and in influence in the state government of Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1817, James Monroe was inaugurated the Fifth President of the United
States. A native of Westmoreland County, Monroe had had considerable political
and diplomatic experience before becoming President. He had been a practicing
lawyer in Fredericksburg, a Revolutionary War participant who had been wounded
in the Battle of Trenton, New Jersey, a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional
Convention at Williamsburg, a member of the Virginia General Assembly, a
United States Senator, an American envoy to France, a Governor of Virginia,
a United States Minister to France where he helped negotiate the Louisiana
Purchase, a United States Minister to Spain, a United States Secretary of State
and a United States Secretary of War under President Madison. His two presidential
terms are often referred to as the "Era of Good Feeling" because wars and
international disputes were unknown in this period.</p>

<p>Foreign policy was a highlight of Monroe's two years. A treaty with Spain in
1819 transferred East Florida to the United States, included an official admission
that West Florida rightfully belonged to the United States, provided that the

against the Spanish government amounting to five million dollars and defined
the boundary of the Louisiana Purchase. Another incident taking place in this
general area of the United States was the permission granted by the government
of Mexico to Stephen Fuller Austin, a native of Austinville, Virginia, to establish
a settlement for colonization on a land grant in Texas. He became the leader of
the section and participated in so many happenings in the history of Texas that
later, the capital, Austin, was named in his honor.</p>

<p>While Monroe was President, Congress had a difficult situation to face. Missouri
applied for admission to the Union in 1819. Since there were eleven free
and eleven slave states in the Union at this time, there was equal representation
in the Senate from the North and from the South. However, the North had
increased much more rapidly in population than had the South with the result
that there were 105 Northern representatives in the House of Representatives
and only 81 Southern representatives in the same body. Therefore, the South did
not want any additional free states admitted to the Union at this time to upset
the equal balance in the Senate. Consequently, a bill which had been proposed
to admit Missouri to the Union with the understanding that slavery was to be
abolished there directly upon such admission failed to pass in the Senate. In the
same year, Maine, a free state, applied for statehood. Slavery had become a significant
sectional issue by 1819 and Henry Clay, a native of Hanover County,
proposed the now-famous Missouri Compromise of 1820: Maine was to be admitted
as a free state, Misouri as a slave state; slavery was to be forever excluded
in the rest of the Louisiana Purchase Territory north of the parallel of 36&#180; 30&#180;&#180;
(southern boundary of Missouri). Although Henry Clay, later known as the
"Great Pacificator" or "Peacemaker" because of his ability to make compromises
in difficult situations, moved to Kentucky in his "twenties," he studied law with
the famous Virginia lawyer, George Wythe, and acquired many of his political
beliefs in Virginia. President Monroe signed the Missouri Compromise expressing
his approval of this bill.</p>

<p>A new trend in foreign policy was formulated by President Monroe, with the
help of his Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams, in his annual message to
Congress on December 2, 1823. The Monroe Doctrine, as it was later termed,
stated that there was to be no further European colonization in the Western
Hemisphere, that no European nation was to interfere in the government of any
nation in the Western Hemisphere and that violation of either of the previous
principles would be considered unfriendly to the government of the United States.
In return, the government of the United States would not interfere in the governments
of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>From the time of the Revolutionary War, societies opposed to slavery were
organized in the United States. Religious and non-religious groups favored the
emancipation of the slaves, but the greatest problem facing those who favored
freedom for the slaves was the finding of a suitable environment for the freed,
uneducated Negroes. The South which had the greatest number of Negroes
would have favored emancipation much more readily if this problem could have
been solved satisfactorily. Washington and Jefferson both opposed slavery and
Washington in his will provided for the freeing of his slaves upon the death of
his wife. Jefferson proposed that the Negroes be freed and then sent out of the
United States. Monroe likewise strongly opposed slavery and suggested that the
Negroes be allowed to settle in an independent country of their own.</p>

<p>In 1816, an American Colonization Society was formed which was granted
permission by the Congress of the United States to send emancipated volunteer
Negro slaves to Liberia, Africa where they could organize an independent country
of their own. The Virginia legislature heartily supported this project. Bushrod
Washington, a nephew of George Washington, served as one of the presidents
of this national colonization society. John Marshall was the first president of the
state branch at Richmond. The capital of Liberia, an independent republic since
1847, is Monrovia, named in honor of James Monroe, who personally urged the
establishment of this independent country for Negroes.</p>

<p>On March 4, 1825, the "Virginia Dynasty" ended, and President Monroe returned
to his home state, Virginia, where he remained until the death of his wife.
Virginia had earned the title of "Mother of Presidents" because it had furnished
four of the first five Presidents of the United States: George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe. By 1825, Virginia had lost its first
rank in population to New York State, primarily because of the large number of
immigrants in the North. The population of Virginia, however, had passed the
million mark.</p>

<p>During Monroe's presidency, an ex-President of the United States undertook
a task in his home state which he had patiently waited to perform. In 1819, the
Virginia legislature passed an act establishing a state university in Virginia.
Jefferson had worked very hard to get this personal ambition of his realized because
he believed that a state has the obligation of educating its citizens. He
constantly discussed his idea with influential men of the time and was elated when
the University of Virginia was finally created by law. Jefferson personally recommended
the accepted site of Central College in Charlottesville, drew up the plans
for the university building and grounds, chose the materials for construction,
selected the workmen and then assumed the responsibility of personally supervising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and directing the actual building project. One of the outstanding architectural
characteristics of the University grounds is the famous Serpentine Wall
designed and built by Jefferson himself. Jefferson's interest did not cease with the
supervision and construction of the buildings but extended to the intellectual area
with his outlining the course of study which was followed carefully at the University
for several years. The University of Virginia was opened for students for
the first time in 1825 with an enrollment of forty students and seven faculty
members. It has continued to be an outstanding institution for higher education
in the United States. This institution, unlike the former ones in America, was
independent of a church and was the first institution to offer the elective system
of subject matter, allowing students to make their choice with music and liberal
arts first included in any curriculum of higher education. Jefferson thus participated
significantly in the education field in addition to making political, historical
and inventive contributions.</p>

<p>In 1829 the citizens of Virginia voted for a special state convention to be held
for the purpose of drafting a new state constitution. When the delegates met in
Richmond on October 5, ex-President James Madison was selected as President of
this Virginia Convention. Other notables present included ex-President Monroe,
Chief Justice Marshall and John Randolph. It was soon obvious that there were
two distinct types of delegates: the eastern "conservatives" and the western
"reformers." Debates and discussions became so heated that this convention is
often compared to the federal convention of 1787 which exposed sharp differences
between the North and the South as separate sections. Governor William B.
Giles, A. P. Upshur, Benjamin Leigh, John Randolph and Littleton Waller
represented the east or Tidewater section while Alexander Campbell, John R.
Cooke, Philip Doddridge and Charles Faulkner represented the western or mountainous
counties. The most objectionable features of the State Constitution of
1776, in the opinion of the western counties delegates, were the following: (1)
the voting requirement of freehold land tenure, (2) the election of the Governor
by the state legislature rather than by the voters themselves, (3) the actual carrying
out of some of the Governor's duties by a nine-man Council of State, (4) the
equal representation in the House of Delegates from each county regardless of
population, and (5) a procedure in the local and state courts which often resulted
in favoritism. The easterner combatted the criticism about representation with the
fact that he paid much higher taxes on his land (in some instances as much as
nine times more per acre). After lengthy discussions, the new state constitution
was finally written and recommended for adoption. The following changes were
included: (1) voting was extended to leaseholders and householders, (2) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Governor was chosen by a joint ballot of the Senate and the House of Delegates,
(3) the power and the responsibility of the Governor was increased and the
number of men and the powers of the Council of State were decreased, (4) the
representation of the western counties in the Assembly was increased slightly, and
(5) state courts were slightly revised but county courts were practically unchanged.
The Constitution of 1829 was adopted, and John Floyd was the first Governor
elected under the new system.</p>

<p>The strong feeling of states' rights in Virginia became apparent once more.
When President Andrew Jackson threatened to use armed force upon South
Carolina in his attempt to coerce South Carolina into paying Federal taxes,
according to the Tariff of 1828 ("The Tariff of Abominations"), Virginians became
very alarmed. John Randolph, a sick man at the time, traveled throughout
the country denouncing Jackson's coercive attitude. Virginia then sent Benjamin
Watkins Leigh to South Carolina to try to bring peace within the Union again
and to prevent South Carolina from seceding from the Union. Governor John
Floyd of Virginia stated that federal troops would meet armed opposition if
President Jackson ordered them to march through Virginia to South Carolina
and to force South Carolina to pay the exorbitant tariff rates. Henry Clay's
compromise tariff law providing for gradually reduced tariff rates prevented
possible secession from occurring at this time.</p>

<p>In August 1831, a Negro preacher of Southampton County, Nat Turner,
started a local slave insurrection by persuading the Negro slaves that it was time
to kill the white people. Sixty whites, mostly women and children, were killed
before the rebellion could be suppressed. Nat Turner and twelve of his accomplices
were hung. Many Virginians believed that Nat Turner's Rebellion took
place as a direct result of the writings of William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts
who published the "Liberator," a newspaper which demanded the immediate
abolition of slavery. The southerners, in general, were so aroused by this rebellion
that southern legislatures passed laws prohibiting slaves from being taught to read.
In fact, a reward was offered for Garrison himself. Many southern states passed
resolutions requesting the northern states to forbid the publication of abolitionist
papers. In 1832 at a regular session of the Virginia General Assembly, an act was
proposed whereby all slaves born after July 4, 1840 were to be free and to be
removed from the State of Virginia. The act was defeated in the House of Delegates
by a close vote of 67 to 60.</p>

<p>In 1831, Cyrus Hall McCormick of Rockbridge County invented the "Virginia
Reaper," a mechanical harvester which could harvest wheat at a much faster rate
than previously harvested by hand with a sickle or a cradle. He did not get it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
patented, however, until three years later. This was a most significant invention
for the State of Virginia as well as for the nation as a whole. The Virginia Reaper
affected grain, as the cotton gin had affected cotton, by making it possible for
grain to be grown and harvested in much larger quantities. When Virginians first
used the reaper, Virginia's total wheat production increased so rapidly that Virginia
ranked fourth among the wheat-raising states in 1840. However, the climate
and soil of the West were more conducive to wheat-raising than in Virginia, and,
when the western farmers heard about the Virginia Reaper, they were anxious
to acquire such a machine for their own use. The usual journey for such reapers
included a wagon trip from Rockbridge County over the Blue Ridge Mountains
to Scottsville, a canal trip from there to Richmond, a boat trip from Richmond
down the James River to the Atlantic Ocean, from Norfolk an ocean trip to New
Orleans and then a boat trip up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to their specific
destination in Kentucky or Ohio&mdash;a water trip of approximately 3,000 miles.
Since the demand for his invention was much greater in the West, McCormick
moved from Virginia to Chicago to build his factory in order that he could reduce
his shipping costs considerably. However, one may still see one of the original
binders at Walnut Grove, the restored McCormick homestead located near Midway,
Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1836, Samuel Houston, a native Virginian of Rockbridge County who had
migrated to Texas, became the heroic leader at the Battle of San Jacinto in the
Texas Revolt from Mexico. General Houston with a small group of Texans
captured Santa Anna, President of Mexico, in this battle and forced him to grant
Texas its independence from Mexico. Houston became the first President of
the Republic of Texas and, later, the first Governor of the State of Texas after
its annexation to the United States. The City of Houston was named in his honor.</p>

<p>On November 11, 1839, the Virginia Military Institute, the first state military
school in the United States, was founded at Lexington. This school was located
adjacent to the Washington Academy which is now known as Washington and
Lee University. The Virginia Military Institute was greatly appreciated because
it was no longer necessary for the Southern young men to travel to West Point
for military training and discipline. V. M. I. opened originally with twenty-three
cadets and two teachers: Francis Smith and J. T. L. Preston, a lawyer who is
accredited with having the concept of a state military institute. It became the first
normal school in the state because during the first year of its existence, the state
legislature passed a law stating that the training of teachers was to be considered as
its chief objective. When the War between the States took place, V. M. I. supplied
the Confederate forces with many of its military leaders, earning for itself the title,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
"The West Point of the Confederacy." At the Battle of New Market in 1864,
V. M. I. cadets led by General John C. Breckinridge defeated the Union Army
by the remarkable capture of a Union battery.</p>

<p>From 1822 to 1850 thirteen additional counties had been created: Alleghany
(formed from Bath, Botetourt and Monroe Counties and named for the Indian
word, "Alleghany" meaning "Lost"), Page (formed from Rockingham and Shenandoah
Counties and named in honor of John Page, Virginia Governor [1802-1805]),
Floyd (formed from Montgomery County and later, part of Franklin
County and named for John Floyd, Virginia Governor [1830-1834]), Smyth
(formed from Washington and Wythe Counties and named for Alexander Smyth,
Inspector-General of the Army in 1812 and a Congressman), Rappahannock
(formed from Culpeper County and named for the Rappahannock Indian tribe
which lived along the Rappahannock River which flows in this county), Clark
(formed from Frederick and named for General George Rogers Clark), Warren
(formed from Shenandoah and Frederick Counties and named for Major General
Joseph Warren who died in the Battle of Bunker Hill), Roanoke (formed from
Botetourt County and named for the term, "Roanoke," which was used by the
colonists to indicate the shell-beads which the Indians used for money and for
decoration), Greene (formed from Orange County and named for General Nathaniel
Greene of the Revolutionary War), Pulaski (formed from Montgomery
and Wythe Counties and named for Count Casimir Pulaski, Revolutionary War
Polish Patriot), Carroll (formed from Grayson County and named in honor of
Charles Carroll of Carrollton), Appomattox (formed from Buckingham, Prince
Edward, Charlotte and Campbell Counties and named from the Indian word,
"Appomattox," meaning "tobacco plant country") and Highland (created from
Pendleton and Bath Counties and named for the extremely high altitude of this
mountainous area).</p>

<p>In 1841, William Henry Harrison became the ninth President of the United
States and John Tyler became the Vice-President of the United States. Both
were born in Charles City County, approximately twenty-four miles from Richmond.
William Henry Harrison had successfully defeated the Indian chief,
Tecumseh, and his brother, "The Prophet," at Tippecanoe River in Indiana.
From this experience he earned the title, "Old Tippecanoe" which became a part
of the 1840 presidential campaign slogan: "Tippecanoe and Tyler too." William
Henry Harrison has a most unique distinction in the history of the United States
in that he served the shortest term of any President&mdash;March 4, 1841 to April 4,
1841. Upon his death from pneumonia, believed contracted during the inauguration
ceremonies, the other Virginian, John Tyler, succeeded to the Presidency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Tyler had been a Congressman, a state legislator, a Governor of Virginia and a
United States Senator before becoming President. During his term of office,
the United States and Canada agreed upon a final boundary in the Treaty of
Washington. Tyler approved the annexation of Texas to the Union near the end
of his Presidential administration.</p>

<p>The annexation of Texas to the United States caused bitter feeling between
Mexico and the United States. In the Mexican War which followed, two Virginians,
General Zachary Taylor of Orange County and General Winfield Scott
of Dinwiddie County, participated in an outstanding manner: the former, in
charge of the campaign at Monterey and at Buena Vista and the latter, in charge
of the campaign at Vera Cruz and Mexico City. Other Virginians who received
first-hand military experience during the Mexican War were Robert E. Lee,
Thomas J. Jackson and Joseph E. Johnston.</p>

<p>On September 7, 1846, the land including the town of Alexandria (originally
Belhaven) which Virginia had ceded to Congress in 1789 was retroceded to Fairfax
County. In the following year, Alexandria County was formed from that part
of the District of Columbia which had formerly been a part of Fairfax County
and the town of Alexandria became the county seat. Five years later, the town
of Alexandria became the city of Alexandria through a charter regulation of the
General Assembly, and its status as an independent city (not subject to county
jurisdiction) was granted.</p>

<p>While Alexandria was changing from a town to a city, another Virginian was
elected President of the United States. Zachary Taylor, a native of Orange
County, became the twelfth President of the United States. He had achieved
national fame during the Mexican War and had earned the title "Old Rough
and Ready." He defeated his military colleague, General Winfield Scott, at the
Whig convention by winning the presidential candidacy and proceeded to defeat
Martin Van Buren for the Presidency. After serving only sixteen months of his
term, he died of typhus on July 9, 1850. The most important issue during his
administration was the slavery controversy.</p>

<p>As in the slavery issue in 1820, Henry Clay once more proposed a compromise
measure in an attempt to prevent, or at least postpone, a secession movement.
The Compromise of 1850 was eventually passed and is often referred to as the
"Omnibus Bill" because it included many miscellaneous provisions, namely: (1)
California was to be admitted as a free state, (2) slavery limitation in the Mexican
cession land was to be decided upon by the residents of the particular area involved,
(3) Texas was to pay ten million dollars for giving up its claim to territory
west and north of its present boundary, (4) slave trade but not slavery was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
prohibited in the District of Columbia, and (5) a more effective fugitive slave
law was to be passed and to be enforced.</p>

<p>While the United States government had numerous national problems with
which to cope during this period, Virginia had several governmental problems.
In 1850-1851, a second state constitutional convention was held. The age-old feud
concerning representation, voting qualifications and election of the Governor
continued until, finally, a compromise was reached. Main provisions of the
compromise were: (1) every white male citizen, except the insane, minors, paupers
and criminals, was to be allowed to vote from that time forward, (2) the
Governor was to be elected directly by the voters themselves rather than by the
General Assembly and his term was to be extended from three to four years, (3)
the Council of State was to be abolished, (4) membership in the House of Delegates
was to be selected upon the basis of population, thereby giving the western
counties a majority number; membership in the Senate was to be based upon
population and property, thereby giving the eastern counties a majority, and (5)
the voters were to be allowed to vote for judges, county officials and members of
the Board of Public Works. In addition, the General Assembly was to meet every
other year instead of annually. The 1851 State Constitution was ratified by the
voters by an overwhelming majority at the next election. The western counties
of Virginia had finally been recognized as an important area whose ideas and
opinions were to be considered seriously. Although the economic and social life
of the inhabitants of the western part of Virginia were different from those of the
inhabitants of the eastern part of Virginia, this Constitution which granted the
western counties most of their desired reforms fostered better unity within the
state.</p>

<p>In 1855, a dreadful epidemic of yellow fever spread throughout Norfolk and
approximately one tenth of its total population succumbed. A Negro gravedigger,
nicknamed "Yellow Fever Jack," was considered the hero of this situation because
he painstakingly kept burying the dead until he too died from the fever. A monument
has been erected in his honor in the Norfolk Cemetery.</p>

<p>In 1857 James Ethan Allen Gibbs, a native of Rockbridge County, secured a
patent to make a "twisted loop rotary hook sewing machine," an invention which
he had created as a result of watching his mother sew by hand. He was unaware
at the time of Elias Howe's sewing machine invention of 1846. After a few years,
James A. Willcox added some improvements to Gibbs' sewing machine, and their
combined efforts resulted in the Willcox and Gibbs Sewing Machine.</p>

<p>On October 16, 1859, John Brown, a freesoiler and an ardent white abolitionist
of Kansas and Ohio, led his five sons, eight northern white men and a group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of five Negroes on a raid of the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Virginia (now
located in West Virginia). Rifles were made and stored here. John Brown had
decided to show these slaves how to revolt against their masters. Therefore, he
equipped them with arms, ammunition and with steel-tipped pikes which he had
brought with him from Kansas. After they had seized the arsenal, he urged them
to start an insurrection. They captured many of the gentlemen slaveholders of this
area, and then John Brown suggested that they use their pikes to "strike for freedom!"
The Negroes of this area and those of the south in general did not respond
to his encouragement. His band killed five people including the mayor of
Harper's Ferry and a free Negro porter of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. On
October 18, Colonel Robert E. Lee of the United States Army, who was a native
Virginian, was placed in charge of the situation. James Ewell Brown Stuart
(later, commonly known as "J. E. B." Stuart) was appointed aide-de-camp to Lee.
Stuart was assigned the task of presenting the summons to John Brown to surrender
after one hundred United States Marines had surrounded the arsenal and
had captured the raiders. Stuart successfully performed his task and was admired
by many Americans for his staunch courage in this action because John Brown
was such an unpredictable individual. Lee then sent John Brown to Charlestown,
Virginia (now located in West Virginia) where he was tried by a Virginia Circuit
Court for treason and for murder because of the capture of guns and supplies
belonging to the government, was found guilty and was hanged on December 2,
1859. Ten of his followers were also killed. This incident caused hostile feelings
between the sections to increase and made the Virginians very angry upon finding
out the extent to which some individuals would conspire to incite Negro hatred
for their masters.</p>

<p>By 1860, the population of Virginia had reached over one and a half million
including 490,865 slaves and 58,042 free Negroes. From 1851 to 1861, four
counties were added: Craig (formed from Botetourt, Giles, Monroe and Roanoke
Counties and named for Robert Craig, a Virginia Congressman), Wise (formed
from Lee, Scott and Russell Counties and named for Henry Alexander Wise,
Governor of Virginia, 1856-1860), Buchanan (formed from Tazewell and Russell
Counties and named in honor of President James Buchanan) and Bland (formed
from Giles, Wythe and Tazewell Counties and named for Richard Bland, a Virginia
statesman during the Revolutionary War Period).</p>

<h3><em class="gesperrt">SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>After Virginia had furnished many leaders for the First Continental Congress,
another special Virginia convention was held in Richmond where a resolution
for military preparedness was passed and delegates were elected to the Second
Continental Congress. Three additional special conventions were later held in the
Virginia colony alone which resulted in the abdication of the last colonial Governor
of the colony, the declaration of Virginia as a free and independent State, the
writing of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the adoption of an official State seal
and motto, the creation and adoption of a State Constitution establishing the
Commonwealth of Virginia, the adoption of the Statute of Virginia for Religious
Freedom and the eventual ratification of the United States Constitution. In the
political field, the names of Patrick Henry, Peyton Randolph, George Washington,
George Mason, George Wythe, Edmund Pendleton, James Madison, Edmund
Randolph, Archibald Cary, Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson and James
Monroe suggest numerous contributions made by Virginians during the period,
1775-1860.</p>

<p>Virginians also had major roles in the military history of our country during
this same period: George Washington, John M&#252;hlenberg, Henry Lee, Jack
Jouett, Andrew Lewis, Daniel Morgan, John Paul Jones, Samuel Houston,
William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Winfield Scott and Robert E. Lee.
In the meantime, the capital had been moved from Williamsburg to Richmond,
Virginia had ceded its Northwest Territory to the new national government and
Yorktown had become internationally famous as the area where the British had
surrendered to the Americans. It is a unique historical fact that the site where
the British armies were forced to surrender in 1781 was located only a few miles
from the site where the first permanent English settlement in America was established.</p>

<p>The Presidency of George Washington started the so-called "Virginia Dynasty"
of Presidents. By 1861, the Commonwealth had furnished the United States
with seven Virginia-born Presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler and Zachary
Taylor. For this achievement, Virginia has earned the title of "Mother of
Presidents."</p>

<p>During the period of 1775 to 1860, many significant activities of Virginians
took place at both the state and federal levels of government: the "Leopard-Chesapeake"
Affair, Jeffersonian Democracy, John Marshall's role as Chief Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the United States Supreme Court, the consent of Virginia allowing Kentucky
County to become an independent state in the Union, the Lewis and Clark
Expedition to the Northwest, the role of Norfolk, Hampton and Falls Church
during the War of 1812, the Monroe Doctrine, the efforts of Henry Clay ("The
Great Compromiser"), the historical connotation of the capital city, Monrovia,
in Liberia, the creation of a non-sectarian state university and of the first state
military school in the country, the attitude of Virginians toward the sectional
issues of tariff, secession and slavery, the inventions of the McCormick Virginia
Reaper and the Willcox-Gibbs Sewing Machine and the active participation of
Virginians in the Texan Revolt and the Mexican War. John Brown's Raid at
Harper's Ferry increased sectionalism and intensified the slavery problem. By
1860, the population of Virginia had reached over one and one-half million
people, including approximately 500,000 slaves.</p>

Historical Life: 1860-Present</h2>

<h3><em>The War Between the States</em></h3>


<p>In November 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United
States. He represented the Republican Party which strongly opposed slavery,
and he had made numerous speeches stating his personal opposition to it. Although
Lincoln had declared that he had no desire to interfere with slavery in the states
where it already existed, he also had made the following statement: "A house
divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure
permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved:
I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect that it will cease to be divided.
It will become all one thing or all the other." Thus, on December 20, it was not
a complete surprise that a special convention held at Charleston, South Carolina,
resulted in the secession of South Carolina, a strong pro-slavery state, from the
Union. By February 1861, six other southern states had acted likewise. The
Confederate States of America was organized at Montgomery, Alabama, with
Jefferson Davis as its President.</p>

<p>Until this time, Virginia had not declared herself. Like her neighboring states,
she had to make the momentous decision. The Governor of Virginia at this time
was John Letcher, later known as the "War Governor" of Virginia. The people of
Virginia did not enthusiastically favor secession, that is, they did not have an
ardent desire to leave the Union as South Carolina had had. Neither did Virginia
believe in the national policy of coercion of a state to return to the Union. In
an attempt to bring the seceded states back into the Union and to try to find some
solution to the slavery problem, the Virginia legislature invited delegates from all
the states to attend a national "Peace Conference" at Washington on February 4.
Virginia appointed John Tyler (ex-President), Judge John Robertson, James A.
Seddon, William C. Rives and George W. Summers to attend this conference.
There was so much sectionalism bitter with political and economic rivalries at the
conference that it was unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>On February 13, 1861, a special state convention was held in Richmond to
discuss the possibility of secession. When the counties elected the 152 delegates
to this special state convention, their choice resulted in several pro-Union, anti-secession
residents of the state. John Janney was the presiding officer of the convention.
It was evident that the majority of the delegates hesitated to leave the
Union because they had very strong ties with the Federal government. Virginia
had played an important role in creating the Union and had furnished one-third
of all the Presidents, numerous cabinet members, a Supreme Court Chief Justice
who held this position for thirty-four years (John Marshall), and other less important
Federal officials. The convention delegates sent a committee consisting of
William B. Preston, George W. Randolph and Alexander H. H. Stuart to President
Lincoln to plead for a peaceful solution to the slavery and secession problems.</p>

<p>On March 10, 1861, the Committee on Federal Relations at the Richmond
convention submitted reports consisting of fourteen resolutions to the convention.
These resolutions expressed the doctrine of states' rights, criticized slavery interference,
advocated the right of secession and resolved that Virginia would be
justified in seceding only if the Federal government usurped state powers or if it
attempted to force the payment of tax duties from the seceded states or if it
recaptured certain Southern forts. The first twelve resolutions had been adopted
at the time of the unofficial firing on Fort Sumter, near Charleston, South Carolina
on April 12th and the forced surrender of the Federal garrison. The Federal
government had sent arms, troops and provisions to the aid of Colonel Robert
Anderson at Fort Sumter. The Confederate government had considered the action
a hostile act and had acted accordingly. The actual signal for the attack was given
by Roger Pryor, a strong secessionist from Virginia; furthermore, the actual shot
was fired by another Virginia secessionist, Edmund Ruffin. The ultimate surrender
of Fort Sumter to the Confederates resulted in an immediate call from President
Lincoln for volunteers to save the Union.</p>

<p>Even as late as April 4, the Richmond convention had rejected secession by a
vote of two to one. Some of the minority were strong in their wishes to secede
immediately and to join the Confederacy, and they used the issues of self-government,
states' rights and slavery as their points of variance with the national
government. Furthermore, these advocates believed that an alliance with the
Confederacy would at least remove them from the direct influence of high protective
tariffs since a clause prohibiting protective tariffs had been included in the
Constitution of the Confederacy. Two days after the firing on Fort Sumter,
April 15, President Lincoln called on all the states in the Union to send volunteers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
numbering 75,000 total, to invade the seceding states and to coerce them
back into the Union.</p>

<p>Two days later, April 17, 1861, the Virginia Convention passed an ordinance
of secession by a vote of 88 to 55. Many pre-Union Virginians at this convention
preferred to choose secession rather than to send troops to fight against their
southern neighbor states. In the previous election, the Virginia people voted
overwhelmingly to have the convention submit its results for their voting approval
or disapproval via referendum. On May 4, a large majority of the Virginia citizens
voted their approval of secession. Nevertheless, although eastern Virginia
voted almost solidly for secession, western Virginia voted almost as solidly against
secession. Governor John Letcher of Virginia sent the following reply to the
United States Secretary of War, Simon Cameron: "In reply to this communication
I have only to say that the militia of Virginia will not be furnished to the
powers at Washington for any such use of purpose as they have in view. Your
object is to subjugate the Southern States, and a requisition made upon me for
such an object&mdash;an object, in my judgment, not within the purview of the Constitution,
or the Act of 1795&mdash;will not be complied with. You have chosen to
inaugurate civil war, and having done so, we will meet it in a spirit as determined
as the Administration has exhibited towards the South."</p>

<p>On April 25, the same convention members passed an act which provided for
the adoption of the Constitution of the Provisional Government of the Confederate
States of America, and Virginia became the eighth state of the Confederate
States of America. Although Montgomery, Alabama, had been the capital of
the Confederacy, one month after Virginia joined, Virginia invited the Confederacy
to make Richmond its capital. The offer was accepted on May 21.
Virginia thus became the focus of major battles of the War between the States
during the four-year period: 1861-1865.</p>

<p>Colonel Robert E. Lee was a United States Army officer at this time and had
one of the most difficult decisions to make. He was recognized as a man of great
military ability, and the high regard which the Federal government had for him
was expressed in the tremendously responsible position offered to him by President
Lincoln. Lincoln was familiar with his great military strategy which had been
followed in the Mexican War, his efficient administration as Superintendent of
West Point, his excellent cavalry supervision on the frontier and his carefully
planned capture of John Brown and his raiders at Harper's Ferry. Consequently,
on April 18, President Lincoln had offered him the command of the Union forces.
Lee realized the wonderful honor for which he had been selected and was deeply
appreciative. However, he was a Virginian, and, after his state had seceded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the Union, he believed that there was no choice in the matter. His love of country
was great, but the love of his state and his fellowmen was greater. Therefore,
he sadly declined Lincoln's offer and stated that "though opposed, to secession
and deprecating war, I could take no part in an invasion of the Southern States."
Thus, as soon as Virginia seceded from the Union, he resigned his United States
Army Commission on April 20 with the words: "Sir: I have the honor to tender
the resignation of my commission as Colonel of the first regiment of cavalry.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant&mdash;Robert E. Lee."</p>

<p>Lee then went to Richmond at the invitation of the convention and was made
Major-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Virginia forces on April 23. It
should be noted here that Virginia did not have an aggressive, warlike attitude
toward the Union. Governor John Letcher is quoted as speaking to Robert E. Lee
in the convention itself in the following manner: "Yesterday, your mother, Virginia,
placed her sword in your hand upon the implied condition that we know
you will keep to the letter and in spirit, that you will draw it only in her defense,
and that you will fall with it in your hand rather than that the object for which
it was placed there shall fail."</p>

<p>For the first three and a half years of the War between the States, the military
actions took place simultaneously in two different areas: a small area in northern
and northeastern Virginia and a western area in the region bounded by the
Mississippi River, the Cumberland River, and the Appalachian Mountains. For
most of the war, the Confederate forces were on the defensive side. With General
Robert E. Lee as Commander-in-Chief, the Confederates had unity of command
whereas the Union forces actually had five successive generals before appointing
Ulysses S. Grant as the supreme commander. Many of the best military minds
were fighting on the Confederate side, and it is believed by several historians that
only their great strategic ability and planning against larger military forces with
better equipment and clothing kept the war from being concluded at a much
earlier date.</p>

<p>The major objective of the Federal government became a clearcut one, namely,
to capture Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. Thus, a chief aim of the
military forces in Virginia was the protection and defense of Richmond at all
times. Virginia lost Accomack and Northampton Counties on the Eastern Shore
at the beginning of the war and was unable to obtain control of Union Fort
Monroe.</p>

<p>On May 24, 1861 the Fire Zouaves, a unit of the United States Army,
marched from Washington to Alexandria, the first point of invasion in Virginia
in the War between the States. They took possession of Alexandria in the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the United States and found no organized opposition because there were no
Southern troops here. Virginia had not been ready for war and had made no
preparations for war. The only standing army in the state at the time of her
secession was a group of soldiers whose duty had been to guard public property
in Richmond. Several volunteer companies had organized in various parts of the
state for the first time after John Brown's Raid. One of the first immediate tasks
to be done was the training of soldiers in Virginia and the acquiring of cannon
and fire-arms. Consequently, it was not unusual for Alexandria not to have had
an organized force by May 24, awaiting Federal invasion. As these Fire Zouaves
entered Alexandria, they noticed a Confederate flag flying from the top of a small
hotel called the Marshall House. Colonel Elmer Ellsworth, the Federal commander,
decided to obtain this flag. He entered the hotel, ran up the stairs to the
roof and grabbed it. He had started to descend the stairs with his trophy when,
at the first landing, he met the hotel owner, James W. Jackson, who had been
curious to know who had been rushing up the stairs and invading his hotel. When
he saw the Confederate flag in the hands of the Federal officer, he shot him in
the breast. Ellsworth died instantly and Jackson was immediately killed by bullets
and bayonets used by Ellsworth's troops. This was the first blood shed in Virginia
in the War between the States.</p>

<p>A skirmish took place at Fairfax Court House on June 1, 1861, which caused
the death of Captain John Quincy Marr of the Warrenton Rifles. His death is
considered the first Confederate battle death.</p>

<p>In the same month, the first land battle of the War between the States took
place around and near the town of Philippi located in western Virginia (today,
in West Virginia). On June 3, Union troops led by Colonel B. F. Kelly clashed
with Confederate troops led by Colonel George A. Portfield. This fighting was
not only a victory for the Union forces, but the retreat of the Confederates from
the surprise Union attack on a dark, rainy night was exceedingly rapid. The
Confederates fled more than thirty miles in one day to a town called Beverly,
thereupon earning for their action the title, the "Philippi Races."</p>

<p>On July 21, along a creek called Bull Run, near Manassas, approximately
twenty-five miles from Washington, some Union forces under the leadership of
General Irvin McDowell met Confederate forces under the leadership of General
Pierre G. T. Beauregard. Manassas was the site of a key railroad junction, an
important line of supply and communication. Although the Union forces were
at first successful, the firm stand taken by the Confederate forces on Matthews
Hill and on Henry Hill led by General Thomas Jonathan Jackson and a counter-attack
led by Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's forces resulted in chaos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the Union army and a panicky retreat to Washington. This was a most unexpected
defeat for the Union forces. "J. E. B." Stuart served under Joseph Johnston
at this time and led a successful mounted charge against the Federal infantry.
He also helped create disorder and panic in their lines. This first Battle of Bull
Run or Battle of Manassas was the occasion for T. J. Jackson's famous nickname:
"Stonewall." General Bernard E. Bee, a South Carolinian, headed some troops
which had become panicky, and, as he saw T. J. Jackson's brigade in correct line
formation, he is said to have made the following comment to his group: "Look!
There is Jackson and his brigade standing like a stone wall. Rally behind the
Virginians." From that time on, T. J. Jackson was called "Stonewall" Jackson.
As the Union forces neared Manassas, Captain Alexander, a Confederate officer,
spotted their coming from his lookout station. He relayed their approach by wigwagging
signals with flags. This action is believed to be the origin of semaphoring.
This battle caused the North to realize that the conquering of the South was not
the easy task that it had predicted or had assumed. Their military slogan "On to
Richmond" became a military challenge rather than an accepted conclusion.</p>

<p>President Lincoln had declared a blockade of the Southern ports as soon as
the war had started. The Federal Navy Yard at Norfolk was captured by the
Confederates without resistance. The United States ships were only twelve in
number at the beginning of the war, but others were quickly constructed. The
Confederates hoped to keep the James River open at all times. They needed ships
badly, having had no navy to draw upon for ships. When the Federal employees
had abandoned the Norfolk Navy Yard, they had sunk a wooden frigate called
the "Merrimac." Governor Letcher of Virginia ordered that this ship be raised
and be converted into an effective, usable frigate. Lieutenant John M. Brooke,
John L. Porter, W. P. Williamson and others planned together for a converted
ship. Finally, the hull of the old ship was covered with pine, oak and iron plates
from the famous Tredegar Iron Works of Richmond. It was equipped with ten
guns and an inexperienced crew under the ex-United States Naval Commander,
Franklin Buchanan. This iron-clad vessel was renamed the "Virginia," and it
traveled to Hampton Roads to attack the Federal fleet on March 8, 1862. When
it first received gunfire from a Federal ship, the shots surprisingly glanced off
its sides. The vessel moved very slowly. When at close range, it pierced the
"Cumberland" with its iron ram causing it to sink. The next day, much to its surprise,
it was matched by a Union ship, the "Monitor," designed by John Ericsson,
which was ironclad, smaller, more agile and newly constructed throughout. The
ships fired upon each other, but they could not inflict serious damage. The Battle
of the "Monitor" and the "Virginia" (formerly "Merrimac") was a draw or indecisive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
from a victory point of view. However, it is important historically as the
first battle of ironclad vessels in the United States. The "Virginia" was later blown
up when the Confederates evacuated Norfolk.</p>

<p>On March 23 of the same year, "Stonewall" Jackson became the aggressor and
attacked a Union force at Kernstown, near Winchester. However, when one of
his brigade became short of ammunition, he had to retreat southward. This battle
was the beginning of Jackson's "Valley Campaign."</p>

<p>Beginning on April 5 and continuing for approximately one month, an important
siege took place at Yorktown. After a line of fortifications had been
erected across the Peninsula from the Warwick River to Yorktown by the Confederate
Commander John B. Magruder, General Joseph E. Johnston entrenched
his army here. Union General George B. McClellan coming from Fort Monroe
besieged the area for weeks and finally mounted his large size guns. With this
action, Johnston withdrew since he was not equipped for such heavy fighting.
As General Johnston's forces were retreating from Yorktown, they met an advance
section of McClellan's army about one mile east of Williamsburg. Johnston was
forced to fight at this time because he did not want them to capture his wagon
train. Both armies fought valiantly, and neither side could get the advantage
of the other. When night came, after a rainy day of fighting, Johnston retreated
westward toward Richmond under cover of darkness. Two days later, Union
General W. B. Franklin attempted to intercept Johnson on his retreat toward
Richmond by landing just south of West Point on the eastern bank of the York
River. However, General G. W. Smith came to Johnston's rescue and successfully
drove Franklin forces back to the York River in order that Johnston could
continue on his way to Richmond.</p>

<p>On May 8, 1862, "Stonewall" Jackson decided to prevent two Union generals,
John C. Fremont and Nathaniel P. Banks, from combining their forces. He
selected a position on a mountain top near McDowell, a village in Highland
County. When Fremont's troops arrived under the leadership of General R. H.
Milroy, they rushed up the sides of the mountain, only to be attacked by the
Confederate forces under Jackson and driven back to a retreating position.</p>

<p>On May 23, Jackson successfully captured the town of Front Royal located in
Warren County&mdash;an important area which had been held by Union forces under
General Banks. This was a great blow to Banks as well as to his troops who rapidly
retreated to Winchester. A unique feature of this battle was that among the
opposing forces was the First Maryland Regiment, U. S. A. being attacked by the
First Maryland Regiment, C. S. A. (Confederate States of America).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later, Jackson rushed Banks at Winchester and surprised his troops
to such an extent that they were routed from the town and driven across the
Potomac in panic. Jackson who had been ordered by Lee to strike at Banks
unexpectedly and to create the impression that it would be utterly impossible for
him to converge with Fremont had carefully and painstakingly carried out such
an order. Jackson is considered by many as second in military stature only to Lee
himself.</p>

<p>On May 31-June 1, 1862 the Battle of Seven Pines or Fair Oaks took place.
The left wing of the Union army under McClellan was attacked by Confederate
General Joseph E. Johnston at Fair Oaks Station and Seven Pines, located just
east of Richmond. The Confederates won at Seven Pines but were driven back
at Fair Oaks. The Battle of Seven Pines was considered indecisive. General
Johnston was wounded seriously in this battle, and, at this time, General Robert
E. Lee was put in command of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>On June 8-9, Jackson was slowly retreating up the Shenandoah Valley when
he decided to prevent two Union generals, John C. Fremont and James Shields,
from combining forces by checking or holding back Fremont and then attacking
Shields. He sent part of his troops under General Richard S. Ewell to attack the
forces under Fremont at Cross Keys in Rockingham County. General Ewell
defeated the forces of Fremont very badly and kept Fremont's help completely
away from Shields. Jackson then led his remaining forces north of Port Republic
and encountered Shields there. Bitter fighting followed. Shields was eventually
defeated and driven down the Shenandoah Valley. This was the final engagement
of the so-called Valley campaign. Jackson had proven himself a great military man
who had fought on both sides of the Shenandoah Valley and who had marched
approximately 700 miles in seven weeks in almost continuous fighting with one
or more of the Federal fighting forces. This campaign included five major engagements:
Kernstown, McDowell, Front Royal, Winchester and Port Republic.
Jackson suffered defeat only at Kernstown by the Union General James Shields.
Jackson then proceeded toward Richmond to prevent General McClellan from
entering there.</p>

<p>On June 11, General Lee dispatched General James Ewell Brown ("J. E. B.")
Stuart with 1200 cavalry and infantrymen from Richmond to obtain information
behind the lines of the enemy concerning the specific position of McClellan. In
three days, Stuart and his contingent had courageously ridden completely around
the army of McClellan, acquiring much valuable information for General Lee.
Only one of Stuart's men was killed during the assignment. Based upon the
information furnished by General "J. E. B." Stuart, General Lee decided to advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his army on June 26. The Union forces under General Fitz-John Porter had outposts
near Richmond just north of the Chickahominy River in the town of
Mechanicsville. Confederate General Ambrose P. Hill successfully occupied
Mechanicsville and then continued to attack General Fitz-John Porter's troops
along Beaver Dam Creek where he severely defeated them.</p>

<p>From June 26 to July 2, the Seven Days' Battle occurred. This included the
fighting at Mechanicsville and at Gaines' Mill. In these two skirmishes, Lee, after
severe fighting, drove the right wing of McClellan's army under General Porter
across the Chickahominy River. At Glendale, Confederate Generals James Longstreet
and Ambrose Hill fought terrific hand-to-hand skirmishes with gun butts
and bayonets against the rearguard of the forces under McClellan. At nightfall,
the Confederates retreated to Malvern Hill. On the following day, the forces
under McClellan set up infantry fire with cannon fire just preceding it at the top
of the hill. As the separate Confederate detachments charged up the steep hill,
they were literally mowed down by the thousands. McClellan retreated during
the night to Harrison's Landing. In spite of these military maneuvers, the army
under McClellan was finally forced to retreat at the end of the Seven Days' battle,
and Richmond, the "City of Seven Hills," still remained in Confederate control.</p>

<p>On August 9, as Jackson was on his way to encounter the Union General,
John Pope, who had started southward, he unexpectedly met Union General
Nathaniel P. Banks near Cedar Mountain (later called "Slaughter Mountain"),
located just south of Culpeper. Severe fighting resulted, and the forces under
Jackson had almost been annihilated when they received reinforcements which
pushed the Union forces back. Since the number of casualties was extremely
high during this battle, Jackson allowed Banks to bury his dead the following day.</p>

<p>On August 30, the Union troops made a second attempt to capture Manassas.
Jackson defeated Union General Pope in the Second Battle of Manassas or
Second Battle of Bull Run, after destroying large quantities of his supplies. When
the Confederate troops had used all their available ammunition, they used stones
until reenforcements under General James Longstreet arrived. These soldiers
forced the Union troops under Pope to retreat to Centerville and eventually to
Alexandria.</p>

<p>On September 5, 1862, General Lee, believing the time was suitable for invading
the North, advanced across the Potomac River into Maryland. As they approached
Frederick, they sang and marched to "Maryland, My Maryland" but
this gesture did not result in large numbers of Marylanders joining the Confederate
armed troops as they had hoped. After Jackson had successfully captured
Harper's Ferry, Lee moved his remaining troops to Antietam Creek near Sharpsburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Maryland. Severe fighting with McClellan's troops resulted and the Confederate
forces in this area finally were forced to recross the Potomac River into
Virginia.</p>

<p>On December 13, the Battle of Fredericksburg took place between Confederate
forces under General Lee and Union forces under General Ambrose Burnside.
Burnside had supplanted General McClellan. The town itself was used as a battlefield
and many of the individual houses were completely destroyed. The city had
been evacuated when it was first bombarded by Burnside on December 11. He
proceeded to use five pontoon bridges to get his troops across the Rappahannock
River. Although this battle resulted in some of the heaviest losses of the war,
Burnside with his remaining forces was finally driven back across the Rappahannock
River with the Union casualties twice as many as the Confederates.</p>

<p>On March 8, 1863, an unusual incident occurred. At midnight, a group of
Confederate raiders, led by Colonel John S. Mosby, made a raid on the Fairfax
Court House which had become federally occupied. Noted for its ruthless guerilla
actions, this group of raiders then made a daring invasion of the Union lines and
continued to the headquarters of Union Brigadier-General Edwin H. Stoughton.
After cleverly getting past Stoughton's guards in the middle of the night, Mosby
himself quickly captured Stoughton as a choice Confederate prisoner.</p>

<p>On April 30, 1863, the Union army under General Joseph E. Hooker, Burnside's
successor, crossed the Rappahannock River again, this time at Chancellorsville,
approximately ten miles north of Fredericksburg. "Stonewall" Jackson was
in charge of the attack on Hooker at Chancellorsville and his troops were forcing
back the troops under Hooker when fate seemed to take a hand. On May 2,
"Stonewall" Jackson had ridden beyond his own line of battle and was returning
at dusk when he was mistaken for one of the enemy and was fired upon by a
group of his own soldiers. He was wounded in the left shoulder, forearm and
right hand and had to have his left arm amputated the next day. He was mortally
wounded and died on May 10. His death was a great shock to the Confederate
forces. General A. P. Hill had also been wounded at Chancellorsville. "J.E.B."
Stuart voluntarily took command of the corps originally under Jackson and by his
own audacious actions successfully led them in pursuit of the Union forces under
Hooker, as Jackson had originally planned. Attacked by troops from the west
under Stuart and by forces from the east under Lee, Hooker and his army were
finally driven back across the Rappahannock River.</p>

<p>On June 9, the famous Confederate cavalry leader, "J.E.B." Stuart, met in
combat the great Union cavalry leader, General Alfred Pleasanton at Brandy
Station, near Culpeper. Stuart had been on a scouting trip between the Union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
forces and Washington, seeking information for the proposed advance of Lee to
Gettysburg; Pleasanton had been seeking Confederate information for General
George G. Meade, who had succeeded Hooker in command of the Union Army.
Both cavalry groups consisted of approximately 10,000 troops each. Excellent
horsemanship was displayed in this action with sabers as the chief weapons.
Pleasanton and his men inflicted much damage and then left in orderly fashion.
Stuart withstood the surprise attack very well and did not retreat in a panic, as
might have been expected. Since the Unionists lost more men than did the Confederates
in this practically evenly-matched fighting, the Battle of Brandy Station
is considered as a notable victory for "J.E.B." Stuart and his men because Pleasanton
had a highly skilled group of infantrymen. This battle was the first real cavalry
battle of the War between the States. It is considered by many military strategists
as the greatest cavalry battle of the nineteenth century. As soon as his battle ended,
Stuart made another famous ride directly behind the Federal fighting lines. He
was later criticized for this trip, however, because he had not been ordered to make
such a trip and was badly needed by Lee at this time to screen planned operations
and to keep Lee informed of the activities of Meade and his troops.</p>

<p>From June 13 to June 15, 1863, a second Battle of Winchester occurred. Union
General R. H. Milroy was forced to evacuate Winchester and retreat across the
Potomac due to the hard fighting of Confederate General Richard S. Ewell whose
troops had captured not only valuable cannon and wagons but also approximately
4,000 Union soldiers.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the War between the States, forty western counties of
Virginia preferred not to secede from the Union. Consequently, when Virginia
joined the Confederacy, a majority of the residents of the western counties voted
to secede from Confederate Virginia at a special Wheeling convention. They
formed a separate Unionist Virginia government and selected Francis H. Pierpont
as their Governor. They had already chosen two United States Representatives
from their Virginia government and they proceeded to elect two United
States Senators. State officers of the Unionist Virginia government were required
to take an oath of allegiance to the federal government. This Pierpont government
was accepted by the President of the United States and Congress as the
official government of Virginia. Three months later, at a second Wheeling convention,
the strong desire on the part of many residents of this area to become
a separate state in the Union resulted in Pierpont's calling together his legislature
which gave the necessary consent for the creation of an independent state from
within the original state of Virginia government boundaries. The new area was
first called "Kanawha" but later the name was changed to West Virginia. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
June 20, 1863, West Virginia was admitted as the thirty-fifth state to the Union.
Although this procedure was apparently illegal and unconstitutional because the
United States Constitution provides that no new state can be formed within the
jurisdiction of any other state without the consent of the state legislature so involved,
President Lincoln and the United States Congress overlooked this technicality
because of a need for military and political expediency in wartime. Governor
Pierpont and his Unionist government in August 1863 changed the location of
his "restored" or "reorganized" government from Wheeling to Alexandria, which
he termed the West Virginia capital city at that time. Alexandria maintained this
West Virginia capital city status until the end of the war and the residents of
Alexandria were forced to live under the provisions of a Pierpont-drafted "state"
constitution. Later, Berkeley County and Jefferson County were annexed to West
Virginia by November 1863 and became an official part of the state of West
Virginia. Eventually, Virginia lost fifty counties altogether to West Virginia,
approximately one-third of its total land area, with their human and natural
resources as well as their financial support.</p>

<p>After the victories of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, Lee decided to cross
the Potomac again and invade the north once more. When Lee found out that
a large Union force under the command of General George G. Meade, who had
replaced General Joseph Hooker, was at Frederick, Maryland, Lee decided to
center his forces at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. On July 1, 1863, the Confederate
forces attacked Meade's forces and made temporary gains. Two days later, three
Confederate brigades commanded by General George E. Pickett advanced to the
Federal cannon center, now called Cemetery Ridge, where mass slaughter of the
Confederates took place. On July 4, the remaining Confederates returned sadly
across the Potomac River into Virginia. Approximately two weeks after the
Gettysburg defeat, a surprise attack on Wytheville, Virginia, was thwarted by the
courageous efforts of Molly Tyres who rode rapidly over forty miles of mountain
road between Tazewell and Wytheville to warn the inhabitants of the coming
attack. Thus, did Virginians&mdash;military and civilian&mdash;strive to help the Confederate
cause in which they so strongly believed.</p>

<p>On May 5 and 6, 1864 the so-called Battle of the Wilderness was fought in
the heavily forested terrain of Spotsylvania County. As General R. S. Ewell was
returning his forces from Fredericksburg to Orange, he encountered General
Ulysses S. Grant who had become commander of the Union army. At the same
time forces under General Ambrose P. Hill encountered the left wing force under
Grant which resulted in terrific fighting within the dense woods of the wilderness.
As the left wing force under Grant was breaking through the forces under Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
General James Longstreet approached and forced the Union troops back to Spotsylvania
Courthouse, southwest of Fredericksburg. Grant retreated in this direction
in an attempt to keep Lee away from Richmond. However, Lee was ahead
of Grant. Although Grant tried repeatedly from May 8 to May 18 to break
through the Confederate lines at Spotsylvania with exceptionally heavy musketry
fire causing thousands of casualties, he was unable to penetrate Lee's lines. Therefore,
he moved southward to the North Anna River.</p>

<p>In the meantime, on May 10, when General Philip Sheridan tried to make an
unexpected rush on Richmond, "J.E.B." Stuart, with only part of his cavalry,
blocked Sheridan's way at Yellow Tavern and saved the Confederate capital.
Stuart was mortally wounded by a close pistol shot in this fighting and he died
on May 11, 1864 in Richmond. He is considered by many military strategists as
the greatest cavalryman in United States history.</p>

<p>On May 15, General Franz Sigel, a Union leader, decided to capture Staunton
in order to ruin the communication system there which Lee had used to be kept
informed about activities in the Shenandoah Valley. He arrived as far as New
Market, in Shenandoah County, when he met Confederate General John C.
Breckinridge who had a comparatively small army consisting mostly of young
Virginia Military Institute cadets. They showed the benefits of their military
training and successfully captured a Union battery. After this had been done,
General Breckinridge advanced, defeated Sigel and drove him down the Shenandoah
Valley.</p>

<p>On May 23-27, 1864, the North Anna River in Hanover County became the
next area of military concentration. General Lee and General Grant were on
opposite sides of the river. Although the forces led by Grant were able to cross
the river at various intervals, they were unable to penetrate the forces led by Lee.
Consequently, Grant turned southwest and proceeded to march to Cold Harbor,
approximately ten miles north of Richmond. When Grant arrived at Cold Harbor,
he decided to have an all-out offensive against the forces of Lee at this location.
His attempt was in vain, however, and he received very heavy losses on June 3.
This caused him to retreat to the James River south of Richmond.</p>

<p>On June 11, 1864 there was an important cavalry battle at Trevillians Station,
in Louisa County, between Union General Philip Sheridan and Confederate
cavalrymen led by Wade Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee. Sheridan had been trying
to reach Union General Hunter who was on his way to Lynchburg. After heavy
fighting on both sides, Sheridan was defeated and retreated eastward.</p>

<p>In the meantime, after General Grant had found it impossible to penetrate the
lines established by Lee north of Richmond, he had crossed the James River south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of Richmond and had set up camp on the outskirts of Petersburg. On June 15,
1864, Confederate General Beauregard held the forces under Grant back for three
days until reenforcements under Lee arrived. Fighting continued between these
two groups until April of the following year. During this siege, the Union forces
decided to make a tunnel under the Confederate defenses which surrounded the
city of Petersburg and to blow up the fortifications via a mine blast. Some Pennsylvania
coal miners in one Union regiment were assigned the task of making
the tunnel and laying the mine. On July 30, 1864 the mine was exploded, and
the shape of the area after the explosion resembled a huge crater of a volcano.
For this reason, this action is often referred to as the Battle of the Crater. Two
hundred Confederate soldiers lost their lives due to the explosion. However, as
the Union soldiers were ordered to charge up the sides of the recently carved
crater, they found them too steep and while they were struggling to get out of the
crater, about 4,000 Unionists lost their lives. The Union men could not see from
behind the lines and continued to advance according to their orders into the
crater until the crater was practically filled with struggling Union soldiers. The
remaining Unionists were driven at the point of bayonets out of the crater back
to their own lines.</p>

<p>While the Petersburg siege was taking place, Lynchburg became the next
objective of the Union forces. When General Jubal Early reached Charlottesville
on his mission to block Union General Hunter, he learned that Hunter was heading
for Lynchburg, the chief center of supplies of the Army of Northern Virginia
and its center of communications. Early's forces in this battle consisted of two
extremes in age: very young men cadets from the Virginia Military Institute and
older men whose hair locks were so white that they were nicknamed "Silver
grays." The fighting lasted from the afternoon of the 17th to the end of the next
day when Hunter withdrew unexpectedly to the west. Early pursued him down
the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to the outskirts of the
Federal capital. Since Early, however, was not prepared for a fight on Washington,
D. C., he returned to Winchester.</p>

<p>At approximately noon, on September 19, 1864, General Early survived a
surprise attack by General Sheridan and his forces near Winchester. Early, in
a victorious mood, even turned the tables on the attackers and attacked them.
Much to his surprise at three o'clock of the same day, Sheridan returned and
badly defeated Early, driving him back to Winchester and eventually to a retreat
up the Shenandoah Valley. Sheridan, whose forces had been savagely attacked
by some Confederate guerilla bands, now retaliated by destroying houses, barns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and foodstuffs and by capturing or killing livestock. The valley was completely
devastated by his destructive campaign.</p>

<p>One month later, however, Early made a surprise crossing of a branch of the
Shenandoah River and drove the forces of Sheridan northward from Cedar Creek
in Frederick County. As Sheridan and his forces were fleeing, Union reenforcements
arrived under the leadership of General Horatio Wright. The combined
forces of Sheridan and Wright attacked the troops of Early and drove them from
the area in great chaos. This victory was the shortest victory in the War between
the States.</p>

<p>During the war, several attempts had been made by the Union forces in the
Shenandoah Valley to capture and destroy the Salt Works at Saltville, located
in southwestern Virginia. In 1864, the Confederate General John H. Morgan
with a small cavalry force successfully repulsed a Union force under General
William Averell. On December 18, 1864, however, the salt mines and the Salt
Works were destroyed by a small detachment of Union forces who were ordered
to Saltville while the Confederates were engaged in severe fighting with the major
Union troops at nearby Marion. The destruction of the Salt Works was significant
because this location had furnished the principal source of salt supply for the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>In spite of the many Unionist casualties at the Crater in 1864, Grant continued
to keep his army near Petersburg. Finally, both sides made their camp there for
the winter. General William Mahone was the Confederate general in charge of
the Petersburg defense at this time. While the winter passed, the Union forces
kept receiving enforcements while the Confederate forces had no reenforcements.
As the Union forces were increased over a large area, the Confederates were forced
to station their meager forces farther apart. There was a scarcity of food and
clothing for the Confederates; the cold climate was most uncomfortable and
demoralizing for them. On April 2, General Grant succeeded in breaking through
the Confederate lines. Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, was informed
while attending services at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Richmond that
Petersburg could be held no longer by the Confederate forces. The Virginians
knew that, if and when Petersburg fell, Richmond would fall next because Petersburg
was the key to Richmond. The next day, April 3, Richmond fell. As General
Richard S. Ewell and his Confederate troops evacuated the city, they burned
bridges and large tobacco and cotton warehouses to prevent the Union forces
from receiving beneficial goods. However, a surprising wind spread the flames
rapidly and resulted in approximately thirty million dollars worth of damage to the
City of Richmond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Three days later, the final battle of the Army of Northern Virginia occurred
at Sailor's Creek near Farmville. The rearguard of Lee's Army on the way to
Lynchburg was completely surrounded and attacked by Unionists. The Confederates
lacked equipment, especially cannon, and were quickly overpowered by
artillery fire. In the mass surrender which resulted, two generals were captured:
R. S. Ewell and Custis Lee, son of General Robert E. Lee.</p>

<p>While the rearguard of Lee's army was retreating toward Lynchburg, the rest
of his army was retreating from Petersburg. On April 8, 1865, two Confederate
corps consisting of starved, poorly equipped soldiers under General John B. Gordon
and General James Longstreet arrived at a village called Appomattox Court
House. When General Lee arrived, he noticed that his men were actually surrounded
and far outnumbered by General Grant's Army of the Potomac. He had
been corresponding with Grant concerning a surrender ever since the fall of
Petersburg. Lee, realizing the futility of the comparatively small group of poorly
equipped troops which he now commanded against Grant's large army, asked for
an official meeting at Appomattox Court House. The meeting took place at noon
on April 9, 1865, on Palm Sunday in the parlor of Wilmer McLean's House.
General Lee and Colonel Charles Marshall, one of Lee's staff members and a most
distinguished officer, represented the Army of Northern Virginia at the meeting
while General Grant and fourteen federal officers including General George A.
Custer and Major General Philip H. Sheridan constituted the remaining membership
of the famous meeting.</p>

<p>The contrasting appearance of the two leaders was very noticeable: Grant, the
victor, appeared straight from the battlefield in a dusty, fatigue uniform of a private
without side arms and Lee, the vanquished, appeared in a new dress uniform
of a Confederate general&mdash;the only one he owned after his personal effects had
been burned in a wagon raid during an earlier retreat. Although the two leaders
had had only casual meetings in their earlier years, their previous acquaintance
seemed to lighten the tenseness of the situation. After an exchange of formal
greetings and general conversation, the talks gradually shifted to a discussion of
peace terms of surrender.</p>

<p>The terms have been described as most fair and generous and they included
the following: parole was given to the Confederate officers and soldiers with the
understanding that they were not to take up arms against the United States during
the period of exchange, military weapons were to be relinquished to Union military
officers with the exception of the side-arms belonging to the Confederate
officers and baggage and privately-owned animals were to be kept for the spring
plowing. Thus, after four years of brave fighting, General Robert E. Lee, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
name of the Army of Northern Virginia, graciously accepted with dignity the
surrender terms of General Ulysses S. Grant and stated that the terms "will do
much toward the conciliation of our people." General Grant then proceeded to
furnish food for the starving Confederate forces. The formal surrender took place
the next day. When the Union forces began to cheer during the surrendering of
Confederate arms, Grant immediately ordered the cheers to cease with the remark:
"The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again." Thus, Virginia, where
the first blood of the War between the States was shed, was also the scene where
the final negotiations for the conclusion of the war were made.</p>

<p>From April 3 to April 10, 1865, Danville was the capital of the Confederacy.
As the evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond took place, Jefferson Davis, President
of the Confederacy, and his cabinet moved to Danville. The present Danville
Public Library occupies the building known as the Confederate Memorial Mansion
where Jefferson Davis held his last cabinet meeting, making Danville the
Confederate capital for a few days. At the time of the meeting, this beautiful
building was the home of Major W. T. Sutherlin. Governor William Smith of
Virginia also evacuated from Richmond to Lynchburg where the state archives
had been sent earlier.</p>

<p>After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, Jefferson Davis and his
cabinet fled to Greensboro, North Carolina, and eventually, to Washington,
Georgia, where they finally dispersed. Davis was later confined for two years at
Fort Monroe, Old Point Comfort, Virginia, from May 10, 1865 to May 15, 1867.
He was finally released on bail furnished surprisingly by Horace Greeley and
other individuals who had strongly opposed Davis and his Confederate ideas a few
years previously.</p>

<p>All the remaining Confederate troops had surrendered by the first week of June,
and the War between the States had ended. Since a majority of the battles had
been fought in Virginia, tremendous damage had been inflicted upon Virginia
during the war. The state had been a constant battleground. Virginia troops, however,
had distinguished themselves in their excellent fighting tactics, and the most
brilliant military leaders of the Confederacy were Virginia-born.</p>

<p>Not only from a military viewpoint had the Confederacy welcomed the addition
of Virginia within its membership, but also from an economic viewpoint. War
munitions had been manufactured in huge quantities for the Confederate forces
by the Tredegar Iron Works of Richmond. Richmond was also the home of the
country's largest flour mills at that time. Because of its plentiful farm products,
particularly wheat and corn, the Shenandoah Valley was called the "Granary of
the Confederacy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in defeat, the courageous spirit of the Virginians continued. The r&#244;le of
women in Virginia as well as in the entire South cannot be overemphasized. They
had suffered physically, emotionally and economically during the war. They made
military uniforms by hand, stood by helplessly as their homes and, often, life
fortunes were burned to the ground, experienced certain types of deprivation such
as a lack of proper food (particularly sugar, salt and meat), clothing, shelter and
medicinal needs and performed numerous physical household tasks previously
done by the Negro slaves although many of these women were unaccustomed to
such hard labor.</p>

<p>Individual examples of bravery and courage, far too numerous to mention, were
common throughout the entire war. A most unusual contribution of the women
was their continuous experimentation in the discovery of food substitutes: the use
of blackberry and sassafras leaves for tea; parched wheat, rye and corn for coffee
beans; sea water for salt; and corncob ashes for cooking soda. A lack of processed
candles and kerosene oil left only grease and wax to be utilized for making handmade
candles. Wood was frequently substituted for leather and seeds for buttons.
Formal education, of necessity, was almost non-existent; with a few exceptions,
like the Virginia Military Institute, education became solely one of family training.</p>

<p>An incident of special interest was the activity of Sally Tompkins of Gloucester
who was eventually commissioned by President Jefferson Davis as a Captain in the
Confederate Army. She had charge of Robertson Hospital located in Richmond
after she had previously used her own money and efforts to get this hospital established
because of the urgent need for a hospital in the Richmond area. She
influenced Judge Robertson to lend his house as a hospital headquarters. Later,
after the government of the Confederacy assumed control of all the hospitals in
the Confederacy, President Davis appointed an army officer as a director for each
one. Recognizing the conscientious efforts of Sally Tompkins in establishing this
hospital at Richmond, President Davis commissioned her as Captain, the only
woman to be commissioned by the Confederate government.</p>

<p>At the end of the war, Virginia was in a devastated condition: private property
as well as public property had in many cases been completely destroyed by fire or by
ammunition. Practically all the livestock had been carried away. Family members
had been decreased in number, and disease and starvation conditions were common
throughout the state. Politically, economically, geographically, historically
and socially, the South had been affected: Virginia, in the heart of the most severe
battleground area, seemed to base its existence for the future upon the "survival
of the fittest" theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>The Reconstruction Period and Its Aftermath</em></h3>

<p>Returning Virginia soldiers found some houses completely destroyed and large
sections of land completely laid to waste. With little, if any, livestock left and
with farm tools missing, the serious problem of reconstruction and rehabilitation
can be easily understood. Railroad tracks and bridges had been demolished; transportation
facilities in some areas were almost non-existent. Even fences, so important
to livestock raising, had been entirely demolished in most instances. So
hopeless did a recovery appear to many Virginians that a few men proposed migration
to Mexico rather than to start anew with such poor living conditions.</p>

<p>General Robert E. Lee still showed his leadership qualities when he beseeched
several Virginians, including Matthew Fontaine Maury, the brilliant marine
cartographer, not to abandon Virginia when the state needed all her sons so badly.
Maury was so impressed by the plea of Robert E. Lee that he rejected offers of
employment from foreign countries which were familiar with his broad, oceanographic
knowledge. Instead, he accepted the chairmanship of the Meteorology
Department of the Virginia Military Institute. Robert E. Lee, himself, had been
offered various employment opportunities but the honor which he deemed the
highest of all was the position offered to him as President of Washington College
at Lexington. Lee's financial gain from this position was to be a sum of $1500
per year plus a house and a garden. He humbly accepted the position and was
allowed to keep his faithful horse, "Traveler," with him in a stable built adjacent
to the President's house. From September 1865 until October 1870, Robert E.
Lee served as President of Washington College.</p>

<p>Lee had two objectives which he hoped personally to achieve: (1) the lessening
of the hatred which then existed between the North and the South so that all
Americans might work together in unity for peace and progress, and (2) the education
of youth in such a manner as to make them capable of living as successful
citizens of the United States. With his deep idealism, Lee was also a practical
man. When he recognized the interest of many young men in writing, editing
and publishing newspapers, he included a course in journalism at Washington
College. This was the first college journalism class offered in the United States.
He was also responsible for the origin of the honor system whereby a student is
on his personal honor to refrain from cheating and is also honor-bound to report
any individual seen violating such code; this system is now used in numerous
institutions of learning. Many of the current attributes of this college are traceable
to the administration of Robert E. Lee. In 1871, the name of the college
was changed to Washington and Lee University in honor of two Virginians who
made numerous contributions to American culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>After the war had ended, a most unusual situation existed in Virginia. The
"Restored Government" under Governor Francis Harrison Pierpont claimed to be
the official government of Virginia although he and his cohorts were responsible
for dividing the State of Virginia and actually had set up an illegal Unionist Virginia
government at Wheeling. President Lincoln, however, had at one time
stated that "The government that took Virginia out of the Union is the government
that should bring her back." He suggested that the present Governor of
Virginia at that time, William Smith, should be present to ratify such procedure.
However, U. S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton persuaded Lincoln to withdraw
this offer. Lincoln's untimely death on April 14, 1865, when he was assassinated
by John Wilkes Booth at the Ford Theater in Washington, was a real blow to the
South in general because he was much more conciliatory toward the South than
the majority members of the Congress who were radical about their military victory
over the South. It is interesting to note that, fifteen days later, John Wilkes
Booth was shot to death in a burning barn on the Garrett Farm near Port Royal,
Virginia. On May 9, 1865, President Andrew Johnson officially recognized the
"Restored Government" of Virginia, which had relocated in Alexandria, and also
recognized Pierpont as the Provisional Governor.</p>

<p>On June 15, 1865, a Freedman's Bureau headed by General Orlando Brown
was established in Virginia. The Bureau was supported by the United States
Government and had charge of the interests, aid, protection and guidance of the
Negroes. This bureau distributed food rations and clothing to the Negroes and
provided educational opportunities for them. Originally founded to help newly
freed Negroes, the Freedmen's Bureau soon became overshadowed with political
activities and severe radicalism with strong racial prejudices resulted.</p>

<p>From June 19 to June 23, 1865, Governor Pierpont had changed his headquarters
from Alexandria to Richmond and his "General Assembly" of twelve
representatives held meetings there. They endorsed Lincoln's plan of reconstruction
and were rejoicing at the comparatively easy way in which Virginia was going
to be restored to the Union. In the meantime, the radical Congress in Washington
believed that the Confederate States had left the Union voluntarily and should
not be allowed to return until they had fulfilled specific conditions. When the
State of Virginia sent her officially-elected representatives to Congress, they were
refused admission. Nevertheless, Congress did allow the Virginia General Assembly
to meet in regular session, and one of the measures passed by this group consisted
of a formal appeal to West Virginia to reunite with the original State of
Virginia.</p>

<p>On March 2, 1867, Congress under the Reconstruction Act of 1867, divided
the ex-Confederate states (with the exception of Tennessee which had ratified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the Fourteenth Amendment providing citizenship for the Negroes) into five military
districts, each of which was under the command of a Major-General of the
United States Army. Later, on March 23, the Commonwealth of Virginia became
Military District No. 1, and General John M. Schofield became the first military
Governor of District No. 1 in 1867. Since Pierpont had been reelected Governor
of Virginia in 1864 for a four-year term, he was accepted as the civilian Governor
by the radical Congress, but subject to the authority of the military commander.</p>

<p>On December 3, 1867, a convention was held in Richmond for the purpose of
writing a state constitution which would be accepted by the Federal Congress.
A large majority of the representatives attending were radicals. Membership
included twenty-five Negroes, individuals of foreign birth who had drifted into
the State of Virginia after the War between the States, many northerners who
had come South to enter politics and a few eligible white men who had changed
to Republicanism. White men of the South who had held high public office before
the War between the States and those who had helped or participated in the Confederacy
in any way were barred from voting or taking part in the Constitutional
Convention. Since the chairman or president of this convention was Federal
Judge John C. Underwood, the convention is sometimes referred to as the Underwood
Convention. The measures passed by these members were so radical that
even General Schofield himself appeared personally before the convention and
pleaded with the members to repeal a clause, drafted by the convention delegates,
which disfranchised approximately 95% of the male white population of Virginia
and disqualified them from holding office and from serving on juries. His plea,
however, was ignored.</p>

<p>At this time, a Committee of Nine Virginians was formed at the suggestion of
Alexander H. Stuart. The chief objectives of this committee were to observe
political developments in Virginia and to determine the appropriate time to report
to Washington on the state of events in order to obtain a more favorable method
for Virginia to re-enter the Union. They bluntly stated that the Virginians were
definitely opposed to full Negro suffrage and declared that many states other than
the southern states, such as Kansas, Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan and Connecticut,
had refused to enfranchise the Negro.</p>

<p>General Schofield prevented the planned election of the Underwood Convention
from taking place in June by refusing to appropriate money for election
expenses. Such postponement gave the Committee of Nine an opportunity to
obtain public opinion backing before the Senate voted for the Underwood Constitution.
The House of Representatives had already voted in favor of it immediately
before the Christmas recess occurred. A representative of the Committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of Nine stated before Congress that the Committee advocated the acceptance of
full Negro suffrage as inevitable in order that constitutional representative government
might be restored at once. Chairman Stuart had already successfully achieved
the support of the Boston "Advertiser," the Chicago "Tribune," the New York
"Times" and the New York "Tribune." President Grant, who had succeeded
President Johnson, suggested that, when the election took place in Virginia, the
Underwood Constitution be voted upon first and then the test oath. As a result
of the test oath, only individuals who had never taken arms against the Union
and had never given aid or comfort to the Confederacy would be eligible to
vote or to hold office. Likewise, it was suggested that the extension of the
white disfranchisement be voted separately. When the election took place on
July 6, 1869, the Underwood Constitution was adopted, but the two separate
items mentioned above were defeated.</p>

<p>Gilbert C. Walker, a conservative Republican from New York and Pennsylvania,
was appointed on September 21, 1869 as Governor of Virginia by General
Canby, a successor of General Schofield. On October 8, 1869 the newly-elected
General Assembly ratified the Fourteenth Amendment&mdash;"All persons born or
naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States and of the State
wherein they reside ..." and the Fifteenth Amendment&mdash;"The right of citizens
of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States
or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."
Congress then approved the new state constitution, and Virginia was officially
re-admitted into the Union on January 26, 1870.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems facing Governor Walker was the extremely high
debt of approximately forty-five million dollars which faced the state. The Underwood
Constitution had provided for numerous additional office positions in an
attempt to force the New England Township plan upon the Virginia County plan
and to create positions for the many "Carpetbaggers" (northern politicians who
came south to gain control of the local governments) and "Scalawags" (southern
politicians who helped the "Carpetbaggers" get control). This increased the cost
of state government. To remedy this situation, the General Assembly decreased
its total membership approximately one-fourth to help reduce expenses.</p>

<p>Prior to the war, Virginia had embarked upon an extensive program of internal
improvements which under normal circumstances would have paid for itself
eventually and which during the war had accumulated much unpaid interest on
the bonded debt. This financial burden would seem secondary to the tremendous
poverty of the Virginians themselves at the end of the war. However, the General
Assembly which had met prior to the adoption of the Underwood Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pledged the payment of all the ante-bellum debt plus the interest, even though
Virginia had lost one-third of its taxable assets because of the separation of West
Virginia. Some of the members still hoped and actually believed that West Virginia
might return to the fold of Virginia after the war had ended. At the Governor's
suggestion, in order to obtain revenue, the state sold its railroad holdings
at a great reduction. Another method was the exchange of certain bonds for new
ones at six per cent interest for two-thirds of the amount of the old bonds. For
the additional third, certificates were issued endorsed against future settlement
with West Virginia. Although these attempts were made to obtain necessary
revenue, the amount received was very insufficient, and the state actually became
more indebted because of them.</p>

<p>Another grave problem which faced the state at this time was the establishment
of a state system of free public schools. This action was based upon a provision
of the Underwood Constitution of 1869 and although having a most worthy purpose,
the action was a costly one. Schools were to be furnished for the Negroes
(approximately 30% of the total Virginia population) as well as for the whites,
and this condition made the problem more difficult since there was a large number
of illiterate Negroes. Dr. William H. Ruffner of Lexington, the first State Superintendent
of Public Instruction, was elected by the General Assembly when the
new state public school system was organized in 1870. The formidable task facing
him can be better appreciated when one considers the creation of an entire public
school system with very little money and few trained teachers available. The
interest from the Literary Fund, all the capitation or poll tax, a new state property
tax and a new one dollar annual tax on each male citizen twenty-one years and
older were to constitute the financial support of the public school system. Local
school and capitation taxes were optional with each county and public school district.
Dr. Ruffner received much help from Dr. Benjamin Mosby Smith who
helped him formulate a program and at the end of the first year, twenty-nine
hundred schools were in operation with three thousand teachers employed to teach
one hundred and thirty thousand students. From time to time, the schools were
seriously threatened when the interest on the state debt was so high that there was
little surplus left for educational purposes. Dr. Ruffner fought not only to keep
the school funds from being used for other state activities but also to encourage
Virginians themselves to favor a free public school system.</p>

<p>In 1868, General Samuel Chapman Armstrong was responsible for the founding
of the Hampton Institute at Hampton, an educational institution whose
primary objective was the education of the ex-slaves. The American Missionary
Society, at the suggestion of General Armstrong, purchased a farm in Hampton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
where the Federal Government had established a hospital during the War between
the States. The school began with General Armstrong as the principal, two additional
teachers and fifteen students. Two years later, it became the Hampton
Normal and Industrial Institute. Since General Armstrong believed in education
of the "head, the heart, and the hands," training of the mind, character training,
and vocational training were emphasized with the over-all objective of preparing
the students to earn a living. The now-famous Hampton singers, originally led by
General Armstrong, made their first tour through England and New England in
1870.</p>

<p>In the same year, Richmond was the scene of a dreadful disaster. When a
sensational political case was about to be tried by the Virginia Supreme Court of
Appeals which held its sessions above the Old Hall in the State Capitol, the gallery
in the court room collapsed due to the weight of the spectators. It crashed
so hard that it broke through the ceiling of the Old Hall of the House of Delegates
causing the death of sixty-two persons and injury to two hundred and fifty-one
other individuals. This tragic incident focused attention on the need for more
careful supervision of the construction and maintenance of buildings, especially
where crowds are likely to congregate.</p>

<p>In the following year, the United States Supreme Court, which has original
jurisdiction in the settlement of disputes between two or more states of the Union,
was asked to settle a controversy between Virginia and West Virginia concerning
the joint boundary line. The Supreme Court held that the new State of West
Virginia was valid and agreed with West Virginia as to the territory within her
jurisdiction. At the same time, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act
whereby the state debt of approximately forty-five million dollars was to be funded.
West Virginia was to be responsible for funding one-third of this amount since
she had helped accumulate this debt before her separation from Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1872, the Virginia General Assembly appropriated money to establish an
agricultural college at Blacksburg. This college was created as a result of the
Morrill Act of Congress whereby federal funds were appropriated by Congress
and awarded to colleges which emphasized the teaching of agriculture and of
mechanical arts. The federal funds were received from the money collected from
the sale of public lands. Therefore, such colleges were called "land-grant" colleges.
The college of Blacksburg, originally known as Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical
College, was the first land-grant college in Virginia and is now known
as the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</p>

<p>The recessions which took place in the United States in 1867 and in 1869
and the Panic of 1873 indirectly helped Virginia because, instead of devoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
much time and effort to Virginia's internal problems as had been planned upon its
re-admission to the Union, the Congressmen at Washington were busy with the
national problem of getting the United States in a more prosperous economic
condition.</p>

<p>When the political parties held their gubernatorial conventions in Virginia in
1873, the Conservatives nominated General James L. Kemper and the Republicans
nominated Robert W. Hughes. Kemper won, and the chief issue in the
election was the debt problem. The Conservatives had advocated payment of the
debt in order to maintain the credit of Virginia in the eyes of the public and to
assume what they considered a proper obligation. However, some of the Conservatives
believed that the debt would have to be lowered somewhat if it were
ever to be paid in full and that, from a practical standpoint, it would have to be
adjusted to the ability of the state to pay. This group of Conservatives was called
the "Readjusters." In 1870, the state had been gerrymandered (districted politically)
in an effort to create Negro majorities which would guarantee "carpetbagger"
rule because the "carpetbaggers" seemingly had been very helpful to the
Negro. The Conservatives who had won the election then enacted some reapportionment
laws which resulted in the restoration of white rule in the cities. They
also took it upon themselves to abolish approximately one-third of the local jobs
created by the Underwood Constitution. In 1876, a law was passed which required
the payment of a poll tax before voting in the state of Virginia. Although originally
this tax was levied for revenue purposes, it automatically kept some of the Negroes
from the voting polls because they could not afford to pay this tax. At the same
time another law was passed, disfranchising all voters who had been found guilty
at any time of petty larceny. Since this method had been commonly used by the
Negroes directly after their emancipation, this law was criticized by some individuals
as discriminatory toward the Negroes and contrary to the Fourteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p>As time passed, the old question of the state debt loomed more important and
more controversial than ever. The problem had two types of backers: one group
called the "Readjusters" who believed that the debt should be drastically reduced
or practically repudiated; the other group called the "Funders" who believed that
Virginia was honor-bound to pay the original debt in full. The "Funders" surprisingly
enough consisted of the planter and merchant class men whose financial
losses had been the greatest during the war. The "Readjusters" persuaded the
Negroes to adhere to their ideas primarily for political reasons. The arguments
centered around such issues as: (1) whether the interest on the debt should have
been cumulative during the War between the States, (2) whether Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Walker had greatly over-estimated the potential resources of Virginia in considering
the capacity of the ability of the people to pay, (3) whether the payment of
a debt primarily because the honor of a state is involved is a major factor in an
economic world, (4) whether the Federal government had regarded the State of
Virginia as "conquered territory" and hence should assume the ante-bellum debts
of this "conquered territory," (5) whether the debt itself should be reduced in all
fairness because of the severe war property destruction in Virginia and because
one-third of Virginia's entire state area had been reduced by the creation of West
Virginia as a separate and permanent state, (6) whether Virginia had been forced
by the Federal government to have the status of Military District No. 1 from
1865 to 1870 and hence would the state be held responsible for debts incurred
during this period, and (7) whether local state government debts should be paid
before payment should be made to outside debtors such as those in New York
and London. In 1877 Colonel Frederick W. M. Holliday, the Conservative or
"Funder" candidate, defeated General William Mahone, the "Readjuster" candidate
for the Governorship.</p>

<p>Mahone subsequently succeeded in getting himself elected to the United States
Senate in 1879. He became so politically influential that he eventually secured
the nomination and the election of a "Readjuster" Governor for Virginia in 1881
and a Republican Lieutenant-Governor. At this time, he publicly declared himself
a Republican. His "Readjuster" friends gained control of the General Assembly
and removed several state government officials solely for political reasons. Mahone
was considered responsible for the use of the "Spoils" System throughout the State
of Virginia. During the administration of a Readjuster Governor, the debt of
Virginia, as could be expected, was re-adjusted to approximately $23,000,000.
Since many of the Readjuster party members consisted of Negroes, the poll tax
was repealed also. The public school system and even the court system became
infiltrated with politics. Often the responsible positions in these fields were filled
by employees of political ability or affiliation rather than by employees with qualifications
pertinent to such positions. After much rioting and corruption, Mahone's
political machine finally lost control of the state in 1883.</p>

<p>A permanent reminder of the "Readjuster" Party was formulated in 1880 with
the creation of Dickenson County from Russell, Wise and Buchanan Counties.
It was named for one of the leaders of the "Readjuster" Party, William J. Dickenson.
This county has the distinction of being the youngest county in Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1892, the state debt problem was settled more satisfactorily when the balance
of the debt was established at a figure lower than the original but higher than the
"Readjuster" figure and the rate of interest was lowered. The creditors and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
debtors cooperated in this situation, and the credit of Virginia was gradually re-established.</p>

<p>During the Reconstruction Period, a great majority of the Republican Party
members in the South were Negroes. Lincoln, himself, had been a Republican.
Since it was during his administration that the war started and that the Emancipation
Proclamation had been issued, the word "Republican" in the South had for
many individuals the connotation of a moral and social stigma. So permanent
were the scars of events of the Republican Reconstruction era that until 1920, the
former seceded states never cast an electoral vote for a Republican candidate in a
national election. Thus, a vote solidly or unanimously for the Democratic Party
resulted and the term "Solid South" came into existence.</p>

<p>In the Spanish-American War of 1898, many Virginians fought valiantly for
their country. The outstanding contributions of such Virginians as Dr. Walter
Reed (birthplace, Gloucester County) and his colleague, Dr. Robert Powel Page
Cooke, in discovering that yellow fever was transmitted to human beings by the
bite of mosquitoes, Major-General Fitzhugh Lee (nephew of General Robert E.
Lee) who served as United States Consul-General to Cuba in 1896 and who was
given the command of the Seventh Army Corps in the Spanish-American War
and Robley Dunglison Evans (Floyd) who was Commander of the U.S.S. Iowa
at the Battle of Santiago Harbor helped considerably in the efforts of the United
States to win this war.</p>

<p>By 1900, although Virginia's population (both white and Negro) had increased
at a rapid rate, Virginia ranked seventeenth in population in comparison to the
other forty-four states in the Union. Virginia had approximately 1,854,000 people
including approximately 661,000 Negroes. However, one-third of the area of the
state&mdash;which had become West Virginia&mdash;was permanently separated. In addition,
Kentucky had been carved from within the original boundaries of Virginia
with the consent of the state government.</p>


<h3><em>Twentieth Century Developments</em></h3>

<p>On June 12, 1901, a state constitutional convention was held in Richmond at
the request of Carter Glass, an outstanding Virginia statesman from Lynchburg.
The major issue of this convention was the discovery of a method of reducing the
large number of illiterate Negro votes which in the 1900 election had outnumbered
the white votes in one-third of the counties of the state. Since there was a
large number of illiterate whites in the western mountain regions of Virginia,
careful consideration had to be given to any proposed restrictions on suffrage so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that these inhabitants whose ancestors had fought bravely in the Revolutionary
War and in the War between the States would not be severely penalized. Consequently,
the Constitution of 1902 included the requirement that a poll tax of
one dollar and fifty cents had to be paid as a qualification for voting. Furthermore,
a constitutional requirement demanded payment of three years' poll taxes
six months before general elections. Since the Negroes were financially very
poor at this time, this requirement indirectly caused a great decrease in the total
number of Negro votes cast.</p>

<p>This constitution also included an "understanding clause" provision which required
voters to prove in written statements their understanding of the government
of Virginia. This provision was to be replaced in 1904 by the requirement
of each potential voter passing an intelligence test proving that he could properly
interpret the constitution. Such provisions prevented many uneducated Negroes
from participating in elections.</p>

<p>A State Corporation Commission was created for the first time in the Commonwealth
to control corporations such as the public transportation companies and
the telephone and telegraph companies. Other governmental changes provided
for in this constitution were: the direct election of the Secretary of the Commonwealth,
the State Treasurer, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Immigration
and the Superintendent of Public Instruction by the qualified voters; the replacement
of County Courts by Circuit Courts; the constitutional requirement for the
political status of a city: an incorporated community with a minimum population
of 5,000 inhabitants is eligible to become an independent city, and, as the name
implies, such cities are not subject to county administration; the establishment of
racial segregation in the public schools of Virginia; a considerable extension of
the powers of the State Board of Education, and a change in the age range used
to determine school population as a basis for distributing the common school fund
from 5-21 years to 7-20 years.</p>

<p>On May 29, 1902, the Constitution of 1902 was "proclaimed" by the convention
members, whose delegates voted for its adoption. Although this Constitution
was never ratified by the voters themselves, it was later approved by the state
legislature. With certain revisions which were added later, this Constitution of
1902 is the present Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>In spite of the political influence which had been prevalent in the public school
system of Virginia in the 1880's, by the early 1900's numerous educational improvements
had resulted: the local general public began to favor a public school
system; professional teacher training methods were developed; a Virginia State
Education Association was formed; simultaneous examinations for teacher certification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
throughout the state were standardized; state summer normal schools
were organized; teacher scholarships were created, and education conferences
were held.</p>

<p>The oft-called "renaissance" in Virginia education occurred in 1905. A New
York educator had encouraged various educational conferences to be held in the
South in an attempt to improve education in the South which had lagged far
behind the rest of the nation. The Virginia Cooperative Education Commission
and the leaders of the May Campaign of 1905 (so-called because the intensive
campaigning took place in the month of May) demanded improved schools, better
school regulations, an increase in the number of secondary schools and institutions
of higher learning and a revised curriculum. The State Superintendent of Public
Instruction at this time was Dr. Joseph Dupuy Eggleston whose leadership contributed
greatly to the success of a movement to modernize and improve the educational
standards of the State of Virginia. Vocational training (examples, agricultural,
educational, manual training and domestic economy classes) which had
long been discussed by certain educators became a reality, specific legislative
appropriations for public high schools were made, public school libraries were
established, health checkups for abnormalities were instituted in the school program
and the number of teacher-training schools was increased.</p>

<p>Such educational progress was observed that, after five years of the new education
planning and of the execution of such plans, a spokesman for the Carnegie
Foundation remarked that "Probably no educational development in any State of
the Union is more remarkable than that which is represented in the Old Commonwealth
of Virginia." Practical education as well as theoretical education was offered
with opportunities also available to study improved farming methods.</p>

<p>In 1906, Virginia filed suit against West Virginia in the United States Supreme
Court concerning a judicial determination of the amount of money which Virginia
should rightfully receive from West Virginia as partial assumption of the
state debt accumulated while West Virginia was still a part of Virginia. Eight
additional separate actions were filed against West Virginia by Virginia which
finally resulted in an investigation of the financial status of each area, the debts
incurred and the suggestion of a conference between the two states. West Virginia
originally evaded such a conference but, later, appointed a commission to represent
the state. More deliberation and delay occurred until 1915 when the indebtedness
of the State of West Virginia to the State of Virginia was declared by the
United States Supreme Court as $12,393,292.50. Finally, after continuous postponement
and more court judgments, in 1919 a special session of the West Virginia
state legislature passed a law which provided for the payment of the sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
due Virginia. Over a million dollars was paid during 1919, and, by issuing twenty-year
bonds, the balance of the debt with interest was paid by 1939.</p>

<p>In 1908, the first municipality in the United States to adopt the City Manager
form of government was Staunton. After this form of government had been successfully
employed, many additional cities in Virginia and in the other states
proceeded to adopt the City Manager Plan of local government.</p>

<p>On March 4, 1913, Thomas Woodrow Wilson, a native of Staunton, was
inaugurated as the twenty-eighth President of the United States. He was the
eighth Virginia-born individual to attain this high office, although he had left the
state for a college teaching position and later a gubernatorial post. From his experiences
as a professor of history and as the governor of New Jersey, he had
formulated a personal brand of political philosophy which he entitled "The New
Freedom." He believed that government leaders should act through the people
as well as for the people. During his first administration, he signed the famous
Federal Reserve Bank Act, authored by U. S. Senator Robert Owen, a native
Virginian, and Carter Glass, a U. S. Representative at that time from Lynchburg.
Although he was re-elected President in 1916 as a peace candidate, Wilson
soon had to wage an intensive war against Germany as conditions warranted such
action. He stated his idealism in his famous words "to make the World safe for
Democracy" and "a War to end all Wars." His famous "Fourteen Points" Speech
before Congress concerning the war aims of the Allied Powers was constantly
referred to during the Armistice negotiations and is still quoted in international
conferences. His personal visit to the peace conference at Versailles Palace near
Paris, France&mdash;the first personal visit of a President of the United States to such
a conference&mdash;was history-making in itself. He will always be remembered for
his idea of "A League of Nations," the forerunner of the United Nations, a project
for international peace which is believed to have caused or, at least, to have
hastened his death due to his strenuous speaking tour on behalf of the League.</p>

<p>In 1914, the General Assembly voted for a state-wide law providing for the
prohibition of liquor. This law went into effect on November 1, 1916. At the
federal level, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States which prohibited the "manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating
liquors" throughout the United States and its territories was submitted to the
states by Congress on December 18, 1917. Virginia was the second state to ratify it.</p>

<p>During World War I, the state contributed 91,623 men to the armed forces,
many of whom participated in the Somme, St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Forest
campaigns. Most of the Virginia troops fought with the 80th Infantry Division
of the American Expeditionary Forces. This division was called the Blue Ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Division because the Blue Ridge Mountains are located in the home states of the
men from Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania who made up this division.
Noted for their bravery, this division was the only division to enter the front lines
three times during the offensive and the only one to advance a maximum distance
of twenty-two miles against the enemy between the first offensive and the Armistice.
Many members of the 29th Infantry Division were Virginians who served in
France, particularly during the Meuse-Argonne Forest campaigns. Thirty-six Virginians
received the Distinguished Service Medal of the United States Army, the
French Legion of Honor or the Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>On the home-front, World War I caused a tremendous increase in business and,
in some instances, prompted the construction of war camps in various parts of the
state. Camp Lee, near Petersburg, was used as an infantry training base for
50,000 soldiers; Camp Stuart at Newport News was used chiefly as an embarkation
point and Camp Humphreys, near Alexandria, was used as a training center
for engineers. Langley Field, near Hampton, was used as training grounds for
pilots; the Hampton Roads area was utilized for construction of numerous United
States ships and as naval and military bases.</p>

<p>The present city of Hopewell actually owes its city status and growth to World
War I and the construction of a huge munitions plant on Hopewell Farm by the
E. I. DuPont de Nemours Company. As a matter of fact, the manufacture of
fertilizer from nitrogen in the air still accounts for the great industrial activity at
Hopewell at the present time. During World War I also, the famous Tredegar
Iron Works in Richmond manufactured projectiles, explosives, shrapnel shells and
other war materials of necessity.</p>

<p>Among prominent Virginians who played a major role during World War I
was Admiral David Watson Taylor. Admiral Taylor was chief of the Naval
Bureau of Construction and Repair (1914-1922) at Washington. He had responsibility
for the design and construction of naval aircraft and he developed a type
of flying boat during World War I. His contributions were later acknowledged
by the establishment of the David Taylor Model Basin, a naval activity at Carteret,
Maryland, near the Virginia border.</p>

<p>Health, too, was a critical problem on the home front during the war. For
example, a dreadful influenza epidemic occurred followed by a severe fuel shortage
due to a railroad strike. This condition caused many "flu" patients to develop
pneumonia and to die. In Richmond alone, approximately eight hundred people
succumbed during this epidemic period.</p>

<p>As a reminder of the sacrifices of Virginians during World War I, at William
Byrd Park in Richmond, is a 240-foot tower constructed of pink brick. It is called
the Carillon Tower and was erected in 1932 as a memorial to the war dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1918, women received special recognition in the state. For the first time,
women were admitted to the College of William and Mary and to the graduate
and professional schools of the state university, the University of Virginia. It is
interesting to note that, in contrast to the educational status accorded women, the
state refused to ratify the proposed Nineteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution. Contrary to this negative attitude expressed in Virginia toward
giving women the right to vote, the Constitutional Amendment was officially
ratified and adopted nationwide in 1920. One of the first effects of this amendment
in Virginia was a legislative enactment requiring all women to pay the
poll tax.</p>

<p>Virginia continued to play a key role in international events during this period.
For example, in 1926, Navy Lieutenant-Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd, a
native of Winchester, made the first polar flight by flying over the North Pole and
back in fifteen and a half hours. He then flew over the Atlantic Ocean the following
year with Bert Balcher, Bert Acosta and George Noville. In 1929, he
made the first return flight over the South Pole. Rear Admiral Byrd led four
expeditions to the Antarctic and, just prior to his death in 1957, he was the leader
of another expedition to Antarctica called "Operation Deepfreeze" at which time
he was consulted concerning many ideas of importance to the safety and progress
of the expedition. During World War II, he did secret work for the United
States Government and furnished much valuable information concerning terrain
of the land which he had mapped on his third Antarctic expedition. He wrote
"Skyward," "Little America," "Discovery," "Exploring with Byrd" and "Alone"
describing his various explorations. Richard Evelyn Byrd will always be remembered
as one of the greatest explorers in United States history. An eight-foot high
bronze statue of the late Admiral Richard E. Byrd was recently erected on the
Virginia side of the Potomac River between the Arlington Cemetery and the
Memorial Bridge. The statue depicts him in his middle thirties when he was at
the height of his exploration career. He is clad in a fur outfit and is mounted on
a four foot pedestal with fitting carved maps of the Arctic and Antarctic regions
and an eagle as a background symbolizing his achievements.</p>

<p>In 1926, the famous project now known as the Restoration of Williamsburg
began. The original purpose of the restoration was to benefit the people of the
present in "That the Future May Learn from the Past." Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin,
the late Rector of Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg, was responsible for
interesting John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in such a project. To date, not only have 350
buildings been reconstructed, 82 buildings been restored and 619 buildings been
torn down, but also many of the early crafts such as wigmaking, millinery-making,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
silversmithing, printing, shoe-making and repairing, cabinetmaking,
blacksmithing and glassmaking have been revived. These craft shops are open to
the public. A visit to the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary,
the Bruton Parish Church (Episcopal), the Public Gaol, the Magazine, the
Raleigh Tavern, the Capitol or the Governor's Palace provides an appreciation
of life as it existed in the colonial period.</p>

<p>During the early 1920's there was much discussion within the state concerning
the need for government reorganization at the state level. During the governorship
of Harry F. Byrd (1926-1930), considerable effort was made to reorganize
the state government with the objective of increasing its efficiency. The Reorganization
Act of 1927 provided that only the executive offices of Governor, Lieutenant-Governor
and Attorney-General were to be elected by popular vote; that the state
legislature was to have the authority to elect the auditor and that the Governor
was to appoint other executive officials with confirmation by the General Assembly.
The structure and functions of the various state departments were also
changed by this act to make each department more effective. Twelve administrative
departments were created, and, in most instances, department heads were
made appointive positions rather than elective ones. The twelve departments
created were: Finance, Taxation, Agriculture and Immigration, Workmen's Compensation,
Corporations, Highways, Conservation and Development, Health,
Public Welfare, Education, Law, and Labor and Industry.</p>

<p>During this same period, the "Pay-as-You-Go" system for roadbuilding was
adopted. This system means that, instead of floating large bond issues to raise
revenue for roadbuilding, the state pays for the roads as they are built, with some
of the revenue obtained from gasoline taxes and fees from motor vehicle licenses.
During the first few years of the system while adequate funds were being accumulated,
the state did not have the total mileage of modern roads which would have
been built more rapidly through borrowing; however, as the funds increased, the
state was able to develop an excellent system of state and local highways. The
"Pay-as-You-Go" system has reflected favorably on the state's financial reputation.</p>

<p>Virginia made national headlines in the Presidential election of 1928. For the
first time since 1872, the Republican set of electors in Virginia was chosen by
a majority of the Virginia voters. Consequently, the Republican Presidential
candidate that year, Herbert Hoover, received the twelve electoral votes of
Virginia.</p>

<p>Virginia was fortunate in escaping the most severe pangs of the depression
years of the 1930's. The great variety of industries and occupations kept the
Commonwealth from becoming severely economically stricken as was the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
states having one specialized type of economic activity. Surprisingly enough,
some industries such as the tobacco industry and the rayon and cellophane industries
expanded considerably. In conjunction with the federal government's construction
program during the depression years as an attempt to create new job
opportunities, numerous bridges, public school buildings and other structures&mdash;such
as the Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond&mdash;were built. Economy in government
administration was stressed and Governor John G. Pollard (1930-1934)
reduced his own salary ten per cent for one year as a part of the economy program.
Virginia was one of the three states which was successful in maintaining a balanced
budget in the depression years of the 1930's. Although the relief cost in
Virginia was below the national average relief, at one point during the depression,
over 50,000 families and single individuals had become dependent upon the dole
system&mdash;especially industrial workers in the cities. Job-finding committees were
organized in many sections of the state to stimulate re-employment.</p>

<p>After the national census of 1930 had been taken and the results had been
tabulated, the state legislature of Virginia passed an act dividing the Commonwealth
into nine Congressional districts instead of its previous ten districts. This
decrease took place because of a smaller increase in population in Virginia in
proportion to other states of the United States. This act was found to be objectionable
by some residents who stated that the new seventh district was disproportionately
large. After suit had been filed, the Virginia Court of Appeals
declared the act invalid on the grounds that it did not provide for equal representation
as required by the United States Constitution. As a result, in the 1932
national election, all the United States Representatives from Virginia were elected
at-large by the whole state electorate rather than by particular districts. Subsequently,
the legislature redistricted properly, and at the next election Congressmen
from Virginia were chosen by, and represented, particular Congressional districts.
Like a large majority of the states in the 1932 national election, Virginians gave
Franklin D. Roosevelt a victory at the polls with a plurality of 114,343 popular
votes.</p>

<p>During Governor Pollard's administration, the General Assembly passed the
Optional Forms Act. Under this act, two types of county government were made
available for selection according to local preference: the county-manager form,
usually preferred by urban and large rural county areas and the county-executive
form, generally preferred by small rural areas. As a result of this act, several
county administrative offices were merged for more efficient and economical
management.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>In August 1933, a special session of the Virginia legislature was held to select
delegates for a special convention to vote on the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment
to the United States Constitution. Although Governor Pollard at first refused
to summon the extra session, he was forced by petition of two-thirds of both
houses of the General Assembly to do so. Subsequently, the delegates favored
the repeal of the amendment by a vote of 96 to 54. The vote by the people was
actually a referendum vote, but ballots for repeal automatically elected a slate of
thirty delegates-at-large who were pledged to a repeal vote. Later, at a special
convention, the delegates voted to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment by favoring
the Twenty-First Amendment. The General Assembly then created its own regulations
for the sale of liquor and provided for the establishment of Alcoholic Beverage
Control Boards throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>When President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Claude A. Swanson of Virginia
as the first Secretary of the Navy in his cabinet, ex-Governor Harry F. Byrd
was appointed to succeed Swanson as United States Senator. Harry F. Byrd was
elected United States Senator at the next national election. Thus, in 1933, Senator
Byrd began one of the longest periods of continuous service in the United
States Senate.</p>

<p>In 1935, the first national park in Virginia and the second national park east
of the Mississippi River was established. It was called the Shenandoah National
Park and was dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This very scenic
park, which now includes the famous Skyline Drive, was made possible by the
combined efforts of many people: Governor E. Lee Trinkle who publicly advocated
the establishment of parks, numerous citizens who willingly donated property
(because Virginia had been informed by the federal government that it
would have to furnish the land), the state which also contributed land after it
had purchased it or condemned it and the federal government which helped
financially with appropriations and with physical labor furnished by the Civilian
Conservation Corps. This park has attracted tourists from throughout the nation
with its breath-taking mountain scenery and diversity of trees and wild flowers.</p>

<p>Virginia made a very significant contribution to World War II. When the
nation began to mobilize for war, Governor James H. Price created the Virginia
Defense Council. Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman, a noted author, was appointed
chairman of this council, the first in the United States. As in previous wars, the
Hampton Roads area became strategically important; navy activities increased
rapidly in this area; various camps including Camp Lee and Langley Field were
re-opened; and production, transportation and consumption activities created new
records in quantity and speed. Activities at Camp A. P. Hill, Camp Pickett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Newport News, Norfolk, Alexandria, Williamsburg, Quantico and Hampton
Roads reflected much of the war effort of Virginians in this conflict. The Tredegar
Iron Works in Richmond was consigned again to make munitions for the armed
conflict. Richmond along with Madison, Wisconsin, was selected as a test city
for a scrap aluminum drive. The test proved most successful, and the scrap aluminum
drives were soon extended throughout the nation. Various federal government
offices were temporarily moved to Virginia, such as the United States Patent
Office which was moved from Washington to Richmond. Since Richmond is
located within a one hundred mile radius of the national capital and is geographically
and strategically situated from a military viewpoint, it was designated as a
"critical area." During the 1940-1945 period, Virginia furnished 137,000 men
and 3,757 women to the Army (including the Air Force) and 71,091 men and
2,055 women to the Navy (including the Marines). Civilians in Virginia, as in
all other states, contributed much physical, mental and financial effort during the
war in their desire to bring peace again to the world.</p>

<p>One impact of World War II upon state government was action during Governor
Colgate W. Darden's term to modify the poll tax requirement as applied
to Virginia members of the armed forces on active duty. A special session of the
Virginia legislature in 1944 attempted to exempt those persons from poll tax
requirements but the judiciary nullified this measure as contrary to constitutional
provision. Subsequently, by referendum, the voters of the state favored the calling
of a limited constitutional convention to accomplish the objective. A condition
of the referendum restricted the delegates to this convention to act solely upon
the soldier vote and to agree not to consider, adopt or propose any other law,
amendment or revision. The constitutional convention approved a measure which
became the seventeenth article of the Virginia State Constitution: this new article
allowed service men and women on active duty, otherwise eligible to vote, to vote
without payment of a poll tax or without fulfillment of the registration requirement.</p>

<p>Since the end of World War II, war memorials have been erected in various
communities as an expression of appreciation for war sacrifices. The most famous
such memorial constructed through state or local action has been the state memorial
erected in Richmond. A million dollar white marble edifice known as the
"Shrine of Memory" consists of a structure twenty-two feet high and includes
the names, etched on glass panels and marble columns, of approximately 10,340
Virginians who died in combat in World War II or in the Korean conflict. The
memorial, located on a four-acre site overlooking the James River near the north
end of the Robert E. Lee Bridge, is also a tribute to the 360,000 Virginians who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
participated in the armed forces during these two conflicts and to the 100,000
Virginia volunteer civilian workers who contributed much in their various types
of activities. At the base of the statue to "Memory" is a gas-fed torch, called the
"Torch of Liberty," which burns perpetually. Embedded in the floor of the
"Shrine of Memory" are memorial coffers which contain authentic, labeled ground
and sea battle mementos from battleground areas. The leading sculptor for this
unusually beautiful memorial was Leo Friedlander.</p>

<p>The sites of two battles which took place during the War between the States
within the geographical area of Virginia have been accorded official national
recognition within the past few years. Specifically, the Appomattox Court House
National Historical Monument was granted National Historical Park status in
1954. This area of approximately 968 acres includes a reproduction of the Wilmer
McLean House in which the Confederate General, Robert E. Lee, surrendered
the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia to the Union General, Ulysses S.
Grant. The grounds where the two armies opposed each other for the last time
are also included in this park. In the same year, the Manassas Battlefield of
approximately 1,719 acres was given the status of a National Battlefield Park.
This area was the site of the famous Battles of Bull Run or Manassas.</p>

<p>During the 1950 session of the General Assembly, a bill was passed which
provided for a state tax reduction of approximately one million dollars whenever
the tax revenue exceeded the estimates by certain amounts, the amount depending
upon the state budget. This law was later revised to the effect that if the general
fund revenue received from income taxes exceeded the estimates by five percent,
a tax reduction would automatically result. Since passage of the act, Virginia
taxpayers have benefitted considerably through its provisions. On the other hand,
several attempts have been made to repeal the general poll tax. The United
States Supreme Court has upheld the legality of the poll tax by refusing to review
a suit against some local officials who had barred individuals from voting because
of non-payment of the poll tax.</p>

<p>At the Democratic National Nominating Convention held in Chicago in 1952,
the Virginia delegates under the leadership of Governor John S. Battle refused
to accept the "loyalty" pledge adopted by voice vote in the convention. This
"loyalty" pledge or "majority rule" pledge required that each delegate agree to
"exert every honorable means" to have the names of the Democratic Party's
Presidential and Vice-Presidential nominees included on the Democratic ballot of
each state. President Harry S. Truman had encouraged federal measures dealing
with fair employment practices, the passage of federal non-segregation laws and
the enforcement of a strong federal civil rights program. Some of the delegates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
who knew that many of the Southern states did not approve of the Democratic
legislative program believed that the states of Virginia, South Carolina and Louisiana
would refuse to accept the "loyalty" pledge because of this program. Consequently,
when delegates from these states refused to accept the pledge, they
were not initially seated at the convention. Southern delegates, however, protested
that state party rules or state laws prohibited them making such a commitment.
Governor Battle, the leader of the 28 member delegation from Virginia,
stated that a state law assured the inclusion of the names of the Democratic Party
nominees on the Virginia Democratic ballot and that they rejected the pledge
only as a matter of principle. Ultimately, Virginia delegates as well as those of
South Carolina and Louisiana were given seats and full voting rights at the
convention.</p>

<p>The Republican nominee for the Presidency in 1952, 1956 and 1960 carried
the state, contrary to previous usual voting results in the state. In the 1952 election
the Republican candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower, received 349,037 popular
votes from Virginia and the Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson, received
268,677 popular votes. Thus, the Republican Party won the twelve electoral
votes of the state. In 1956, 386,320 popular votes from Virginia were cast for the
Republican electors and 264,110 popular votes for the Democratic electors who
represented the same Presidential candidates as in 1952. In the 1960 election
the Republican nominee, Richard M. Nixon, won the popular vote of the state
over the Democratic nominee, John F. Kennedy. Virginia again cast her twelve
electoral votes for the Republican candidate. However, during this period, the
Governor, the two United States Senators from Virginia, eight of the ten Virginia
members of the United States House of Representatives and a majority of the
General Assembly continued to be members of the Democratic Party, illustrating
the traditional role of the Democratic Party in the state since the Reconstruction
Era.</p>

<p>Public education has received much attention in Virginia, especially since
1950. On several occasions, for example, the General Assembly has approved
million dollar appropriations of state funds for school construction projects. The
tremendous influx of youth in the public schools during the decade of the 1950's
accentuated the need for more teachers as well as classrooms throughout the state.
Hence, rising costs of education have become a key matter at each recent session
of the General Assembly. During the last few years, however, the question of
integration of white and of Negro students in the public schools of the state has
been a paramount education issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>When the United States Supreme Court on May 17, 1954 handed down its
decision which in effect outlawed racial segregation in the public schools of the
nation, Virginia faced a very serious problem because the State Constitution has
required separate public schools for white and for Negro children in the Commonwealth.
Governor Thomas B. Stanley soon appointed a commission of thirty-two
state legislators, under the chairmanship of State Senator Garland Gray, to advise
him concerning a course of action to be taken by the Commonwealth. The commission
conducted a study and subsequently transmitted to the Governor its report,
known as the Gray Plan. The plan recommended consideration of an amendment
to the constitutional provision requiring separate schools and suggested that local
communities be enabled through their school boards to assign students to schools
for a variety of reasons other than race. Subsequently, a special session of the General
Assembly authorized a referendum election on the calling of a constitutional
convention. The referendum question was worded as follows: "Should a Constitutional
Convention be called with authority to revise Section 141 of the State
Constitution so as to permit the General Assembly to appropriate public funds
to further the education of Virginia students in non-sectarian private schools as
well as in public schools?" A majority of the voters voted in the affirmative at the
referendum election held in January 1956. In March 1956 a Constitutional
Convention was held in Richmond and these delegates rewrote Section 141; hence
it became permissible under the Constitution of the Commonwealth to use
public funds for tuition grants for pupils in private non-sectarian schools. Later, at
a special session of the General Assembly in September 1956, a pupil placement
program was adopted under which the Governor appointed a pupil placement
board whose chief function was to handle all student assignments in the state;
under the program, parents of all children entering the public schools were required
to fill out assignment applications which, in turn, were ultimately processed
through the board.</p>

<p>In 1958, legislation provided for the automatic closing of any school which
might be policed by the federal government and permitted the Governor to close
any school in a locality in which another school was already being so policed.
The admission of any Negro student to a public school for white students required
the Governor to close the school and assume full control. Subsequently, federal
court orders directed school boards in Arlington, Charlottesville and Norfolk to
admit students without regard to race, effective September 1958; following state
law, the pupil placement board denied admission to Negro applicants in the
localities mentioned previously; the local school boards in these areas and in
Warren County initiated action to admit Negro students, pursuant to federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
court order. However, the Governor announced the closing of the high school in
Warren County, and similar action was taken in Charlottesville and in Norfolk.
During the Fall semester of 1958, a total of nine schools (one in Warren County
and eight in Norfolk and Charlottesville) were closed to 13,000 students, many
of whom transferred elsewhere. When court decisions in January 1959 voided
the school closing law, the law cutting off state funds and the law providing
tuition grants of public funds for segregated private schooling, the Governor stated
that he could take no further action to prevent the opening of public schools on
an integrated basis. Some public schools in Arlington, Charlottesville and Norfolk,
as well as in Alexandria, began integrated classes in the Spring semester of
1959. Since that time, the number of integrated schools has increased. The
implications of the United States Supreme Court decision of May 17, 1954 upon
the public school system of Virginia have presented to the Commonwealth one
of its most difficult problems of the Twentieth Century.</p>

<p>As the population of Virginia cities and towns has grown during the past two
decades, persons have moved to the suburbs and surrounding territory&mdash;sometimes
at a faster rate than the increase in new population in the urban centers.
The 1960 census confirmed such declines from the previous growth of cities in
nearly all parts of the nation. Attractions to persons who move from the urban
centers include larger amounts of available land, newer homes, shopping centers
with comparatively easy parking, and initial lower real estate taxes. After these
persons have lived in the suburbs or surrounding territory for a while, various
needs such as adequate streets, police protection, schools, sewerage facilities,
water and building and zoning codes sometimes develop or become more apparent.
Often county governments are not equipped to provide for all of these services;
if county governments do establish such services, the initial costs may be very
high for the taxpayers.</p>

<p>To counterbalance the move to suburbs and nearby rural areas, urban local
units of government seek to annex surrounding land from counties or nearby
cities. In Virginia, annexation is determined by a panel of three judges, only one
of whom is a resident of the county involved. No referendum is held to ascertain
the wishes of the residents of the area under consideration because of the belief
that annexation should be based on the need of the majority of the people concerned.
While annexation may be an answer to the urban government's need for
extending its tax base, county units lose their prime tax property. Over a period
of time, the continued growth of the metropolitan area causes persons to locate
outside of the revised boundaries and the process of annexation starts over again.</p>

<p>In addition to annexation, another method available whereby an urban unit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
may extend its boundaries is consolidation of local units. An example is the
merger of a city government unit and a county government unit into a revised
city government unit. In Virginia, consolidation statutes are relatively flexible:
officials of both units negotiate between themselves to reach an agreement on the
authority of the new local unit of government, in contrast to annexation where
the county government is often forced against its will to give up valuable real
estate.</p>

<p>The growth of metropolitan areas has raised a serious challenge to the ability
of local units of government to provide adequate government services to their
residents at reasonable costs. Unless further understanding is developed among
the citizenry involved, the impact of metropolitanism will continue to result in
serious inequities among individual local units of government.</p>


<h3><em class="gesperrt">SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>By April 1861, the Commonwealth of Virginia had furnished one-third of all
the Presidents of the United States, had had numerous other Virginian leaders
in high federal positions, had been responsible for the calling of a "Peace Conference"
in the nation's capital and had been most reluctant to vote for secession
from the Union. However, the inhabitants of Virginia believed in the doctrine
of "States' Rights," in non-interference of slavery by the federal government and
in not coercing neighboring seceded states back into the Union via invasion.
Consequently, Virginia joined the Confederacy, and Richmond soon became the
Confederate capital and the State of Virginia a huge battlefield.</p>

<p>The brilliant military tactics of General Robert E. Lee, Thomas Jonathan
Jackson and "J.E.B." Stuart will always be worthy of military study. Virginia
helped the Confederacy, economically as well as militarily, especially with the
food products of the Saltville area and of the Shenandoah Valley and the manufactured
arms equipment of the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond. When West
Virginia became an independent state without the consent of Virginia, it reduced
the area and population of the Commonwealth considerably. The ending of the
War between the States, like that of the American Revolutionary War, took place
in Virginia. The magnificent courage and fervor of the Virginians as members of
the Confederacy will always be cherished by posterity. When one is well-informed
of the deeds, hardships and activities which occurred during the War between
the States in Virginia and in other southern states, one can easily understand the
ever-present pride which the Confederate Flag does, and always will, inspire.
This era of American history, although one of the darkest periods in our national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
history when even brother sometimes fought brother on the battlefield, will forever
remain one of the most dynamic and heroic periods in human civilization.</p>

<p>After enduring a harsh Reconstruction Program enforced by a radical United
States Congress and by "Carpetbagger" and "Scalawag" governments, Virginia
officially returned to the Union on January 26, 1870. Then the Commonwealth
began settling some of its local problems: the extremely high state debt, the educational
program, the joint boundary line between Virginia and West Virginia
and the "Readjuster" Movement. The newest county in Virginia&mdash;Dickenson
County&mdash;was created in 1880. By 1900, Virginia ranked seventeenth in United
States state population and seemed prepared to meet the challenging events of the
Twentieth Century with renewed confidence.</p>

<p>A new state constitution, still in effect today, was "proclaimed" in 1902. It
provided for a poll tax and an "understanding clause" provision as a voting requirement;
later, the latter was changed to an intelligence test requirement. The
unusual political status of a city, completely independent of county jurisdiction,
was originated at this time also. Racial segregation in the public schools of Virginia
was provided for in the Constitution of 1902.</p>

<p>Other events and activities concerning Virginia and Virginians during the
Twentieth Century include the payment to Virginia by West Virginia of the state
debt which West Virginia had accumulated while she was part of Virginia, the
operation of the first City-Manager form of local government at Staunton, outstanding
participation in two World Wars and in the Korean conflict, the "Restoration
of Williamsburg" Project, a reorganization of state governmental departments,
the comparatively small economic dislocation during the "Great Depression,"
the establishment of the Shenandoah National Park, the opportunity
afforded service men and women on active duty to vote without payment of a
poll tax, the constant increase in the growth of industry, the victory for the Virginia
delegates at the 1952 Democratic National Nominating Convention, Republican
Presidential victories in Virginia in 1928, 1952, 1956 and 1960, developments
in education including the problems of school integration and the expansion
of school facilities and the continuing growth of metropolitanism.</p>

<p>As our nation's history unfolds, issues of state, national and international scope
will continue to face the Commonwealth. The history of Virginia has furnished
Virginians with a proud heritage, an appreciation for the noble deeds of the past
and an understanding of the courage and wisdom required to solve successfully
current and future problems. Virginia&mdash;a vital area of the United States&mdash;will
undoubtedly play a major role in the fulfillment of the destiny of the United
States.</p>

<h2>5<br />

Economic Life</h2>

<h3><em>The Work Force</em></h3>


<p>A variety of geographical resources and of human resources results in
diversity in the economic life of the state. The proportion of the population
engaged in gainful occupation at the present time is significant. Approximately
38% of the total population in Virginia is included in the work force. The group
outside the work force includes individuals who are thirteen years of age or
younger, homemakers, students age fourteen and over, the physically and mentally
handicapped who are unable to work, and persons who are retired.</p>

<p>Census enumerations since 1890 indicate that total employment in Virginia has
expanded continuously. During the seventy year period 1890-1960, the work
force increased from approximately 552,000 to approximately 1,473,000. This
represents an increase of 176%, or an average annual increase of 13,137 workers.</p>

<p>Three phases in the trend of employment are observable: from 1890 to 1910,
1910 to 1940 and 1940 to 1960. The first phase coincides with the Industrial
Revolution in the United States; the increase in employment in Virginia during
this time was 44%. In the second phase, from 1910 to 1940, the rate of increase
slackened although the total number in the work force grew; the increase amounted
to 14% during this period. The third phase of employment began in 1940 as
needs of World War II became clear; unprecedented peacetime demands started
in 1945 and have continued to the decade of the 1960's; in this phase, for the first
time, Virginia outpaced the United States as a whole in growth of employment,
with an increase of 63%.</p>


<h3><em>Types of Employment</em></h3>

<p>Government Employment&mdash;Government employees make up the largest number
of workers in any particular type of occupation in the state. The term
"government employees" includes all civilians working directly for federal, state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and local governments plus military personnel stationed in Virginia. Nearly one-fourth
of the total Virginia employment is found in this group. Government
employment is the greatest single source of personal income in the state.</p>

<p>Approximately 65% of the government employment in Virginia, as defined
above, is engaged in activities of the federal government. The number of military
personnel in the state is slightly more than twice the number of federal civilian
employees. Although federal employment is scattered throughout the state&mdash;every
community has postal employees, for example&mdash;there is a concentration
of federal employees in two areas of the state, namely, Northern Virginia (Arlington
and Fairfax Counties and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church) and
the Hampton Roads area. Within the federal civilian group, approximately 70%
are employed by the Department of Defense. Following the Department of
Defense, the next largest numbers of federal civilian employees work for the
Post Office Department and for the Veterans Administration. In addition to the
federal employees working in the state, a substantial number of persons who live
in Northern Virginia commute daily to the District of Columbia and nearby
Maryland for federal employment.</p>

<p>Approximately 35% of the government employees in Virginia work for the
state (11%) and for local (24%) governments. Since more than half of the
government employment in the United States is found in state and local governments,
the number of such employees in Virginia is relatively smaller. The state
and local group in Virginia is nearly equally divided between school and non-school
personnel. Although the number of state and local employees in Virginia
has grown during the past decade, the percentage of increase has not been as
great as that for the United States as a whole.</p>

<p>Employment in Manufacturing&mdash;Excluding military personnel from the total
government group, employees engaged in manufacturing rank first in number.
However, when civilian government and military personnel are combined, government
employment surpasses manufacturing employment. Approximately 20% of
the total work force is engaged in manufacturing. During the decade of the
1940's manufacturing in Virginia surpassed agriculture for the first time, and
the growth of manufacturing continued progressively through the decade of the
1950's. Manufacturing as a whole is diversified.</p>

<p>Expenditure for new manufacturing plant and equipment exceeded one billion
dollars in one recent seven-year period. Additional millions of dollars have been
spent recently for expanding existing facilities. Fabricated metals (example,
swimming-pool type atomic reactors) and machinery and electrical equipment
(examples, motors, calculators) groups of industries have grown substantially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
within the past few years. The four manufacturing industries having the largest
number of employees are textile, chemical and chemical products, food and kindred
products, and lumber and wood products. The employees in these four
industries constitute nearly 50% of all workers engaged in manufacturing.</p>

<p>Textile employment leads all other manufacturing employment. The textile
industry in Virginia includes the spinning and processing of yarn and the weaving
and finishing of material. Cotton and rayon broad-woven fabrics are the major
ones. Approximately 60% of Virginia's textile employment is found in this category.
The cities of Danville, Fieldale and Roanoke are especially noted for their
textiles. Knitting mills constitute the second type of textile activity, and approximately
two-thirds of employment in the knitting mills is engaged in making full-fashioned
and seamless hosiery. Lynchburg is a key center of knitting mills for
men's and ladies' hosiery.</p>

<p>The second largest employer of workers engaged in manufacturing in Virginia
is the chemical industry. Approximately two-thirds of such chemical employees
are found in the synthetic fiber field. In 1917, the first large rayon plant was
established. This industry has developed rapidly, and Virginia now plays an important
part nationally in this production. Virginia now has approximately 30%
of the total employees in the United States engaged in synthetic fibers. There are
at present large synthetic fiber plants in Richmond, Martinsville, Roanoke,
Waynesboro, Narrows and Front Royal. Virginia has been regarded as the geographical
center of this industry in the United States. Another type of chemical
production involves industrial inorganic chemicals including alkalies&mdash;soda ash,
bicarbonate of soda, caustic soda&mdash;and chlorine (Saltville and Hopewell), sulfuric
acid (Norfolk and Richmond) and ammonia (Hopewell). The manufacturing
of fertilizer is also important in the state because of the agricultural need for it in
the South and because Virginia is conveniently located with respect to the raw
materials necessary for making fertilizer (namely, potash, nitrogen and phosphate
rock). Hopewell and Norfolk are two cities which have large plants for the manufacture
of fertilizers. Both Fredericksburg and Richmond have a large cellophane
company and certain medicinal drugs such as streptomycin and thiamine hydrochloride
are manufactured at Elkton. In addition, dyes, wood turpentine, dry ice
and various insecticides are produced in Virginia.</p>

<p>The third largest employer of workers engaged in manufacturing is the food
and kindred products industry. This industry may be conveniently divided into
two groups based upon the factors which determine their location:</p>

<p>1) those food industries whose products originate and are marketed in a
population center&mdash;for example, bakery products (Richmond, Norfolk and Roanoke),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
beverages (Norfolk and Richmond), meat products (Richmond and
Smithfield), dairy products (Richmond, Roanoke, Alexandria and Fredericksburg)
and manufactured ice (Richmond and Alexandria);</p>

<p>2) those food industries which find it desirable to locate close to the source
of supply&mdash;usually a perishable commodity&mdash;for example, seafood canneries
(Norfolk, Hampton and Reedville), vegetable canneries (Walkerton and Urbanna),
poultry dressing plants (Broadway, Harrisonburg and Winchester), fruit
processing plants (Berryville, Mount Jackson, Winchester and Front Royal),
confectionery plants (Suffolk and Norfolk), meatpacking companies (Suffolk and
Smithfield) and frozen foods (seafood&mdash;Norfolk; poultry&mdash;Broadway; fruits and
vegetables&mdash;Exmore).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fourth largest employer of workers engaged in manufacturing is the
lumber and lumber products industry. In the latter part of the Nineteenth Century
and the early Twentieth Century, this industry had the greatest number of
employees in the manufacturing field. Gradually its importance declined until
the 1930's when it increased rapidly as the demand for lumber production increased
until, at present, it has reached fourth place. Approximately 77% of
Virginia's total lumber industry employees is found in the sawmills and planing
mills, especially in mills located in Franklin, Petersburg, Norfolk and Richmond.
Whereas the synthetic fibers mentioned previously are manufactured primarily in
seven large plants with numerous employees per plant, the lumber industry in
Virginia consists of approximately 1700 establishments&mdash;only approximately 200
of which employ at least twenty employees. Veneer mills, excelsior mills, mill-work
plants, plywood plants and companies which make fruit and vegetable
baskets, boxes and crates also furnish diverse types of wood products for the
Virginia lumber industry.</p>

<p>The fifth largest employer of workers engaged in manufacturing is the apparel
industry. Approximately one-half of all such employees are engaged in making
men's and boys' clothing: suits, coats and overcoats are made in large quantities
in Richmond, Staunton and Norfolk; shirts, pajamas and underwear at Danville,
Radford, Lynchburg and Marion; trousers, overalls and sports jackets at Martinsville,
Richmond and Staunton. Women's and misses' dresses are manufactured at
Roanoke, maids' and nurses' uniforms and sports jackets at Lynchburg, lingerie
at Staunton and Roanoke, gloves at Lynchburg, children's and infants' dresses and
play clothes at Newport News and Shenandoah. Supplementary textile products
include sheets and pillow cases (Danville), towels (Fieldale), hassocks, canvas
awnings and automobile seat covers (Richmond).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The sixth largest employer of workers engaged in manufacturing is the transportation
equipment industry. Most of this employment is found in shipbuilding
at the Hampton Roads area where aircraft carriers, atomic submarines, ocean liners&mdash;such
as the "Constitution" and the "United States"&mdash;and numerous smaller
vessels are constructed. Other employees of this industry work in numerous
truck and bus body companies scattered throughout the state, in railroad equipment
companies&mdash;for example, brake shoes (Roanoke); railroad bearings (Petersburg)
and in a wagon company (Lynchburg).</p>

<p>Furniture-making ranks seventh in number of employees engaged in manufacturing.
Most of Virginia's furniture workers are engaged in the manufacture of
unupholstered wooden house furniture. Such furniture includes bedroom, living
room and dining room suites (Bassett, Martinsville, Staunton, Marion, Stanleytown,
Roanoke and Pulaski), cedar chests (Alta Vista) and radio and television
cabinets (Bristol). Living room upholstered furniture including chairs, sofa beds,
studio couches and furniture frames are manufactured at Salem, Christiansburg,
Norfolk, Roanoke and Galax. Chrome dinettes and plastic furniture are manufactured
in plants located at Marion. Office equipment including floor cabinets
and metal filing cabinets is made at Crozet. There is also an extensive fixture
industry&mdash;bank, office and store fixtures&mdash;plus such items as literary bookstacks,
metal partitions, doors and movable partitions primarily at Orange, Norfolk and
Richmond.</p>

<p>The eighth largest employer of workers engaged in manufacturing is the tobacco
industry. Although the national consumption of tobacco has increased considerably,
the rapid mechanization added to the manufacturing process has resulted in
a decline in the total number of employees. Although only approximately six
workers per 1,000 engaged in manufacturing in the United States are in the
tobacco industry, in Virginia approximately 56 workers per 1,000 are so engaged.
The chief locations for the tobacco industry are Richmond, Petersburg, Danville
and South Boston. These workers are engaged primarily in the manufacture
of cigarettes and in tobacco stemming and redrying. Richmond is the largest
cigarette manufacturing center in the world. Petersburg has an exceptionally
large cigarette manufacturing plant. Cigars, chewing and smoking tobacco and
snuff are also manufactured in Richmond. Danville has the largest number of
tobacco stemming and redrying workers. Approximately half of the tobacco industry
workers are women.</p>

<p>The ninth largest employer of workers engaged in manufacturing is the paper
and allied industries. The greatest number of such workers is engaged in the
manufacturing of pulp. The largest pulp mills are located at Covington and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Franklin. Approximately one-half of the nation's supply of wood pulp is furnished
by the South and Virginia ranks fifth among the southern states in its production.
The newly developed methods of utilizing southern pine for producing kraft
paper and newsprint have caused considerable increase in this type of production.
Kraft paper is usually dark brown in color and is a most durable type of wrapping
paper. Such paper is manufactured at Covington, Franklin, West Point, Hopewell
and Richmond. Other paper products such as gummed and waxed paper
(Richmond), varied types of commercial envelopes and church collection envelopes
(Richmond), multi-wall paper bags (Richmond, Franklin and Newport
News) and paperboard containers&mdash;corrugated shipping cases, cartons, boxes of
varied sizes and shapes (Richmond, Lynchburg) are likewise produced in
abundance.</p>

<p>Over 9,000 employees are engaged in the printing and publishing industry.
Approximately one-half of these employees work in the printing and publishing
of newspapers. These newspaper companies are scattered throughout the state.
In addition, there are other companies which publish books, engage in commercial
printing in general, in lithographing, bookbinding, plate printing, engraving and
in photo engraving. These companies also are located in several areas with Richmond,
Norfolk and Newport News having the greatest number of employees.</p>

<p>Another industry important to Virginia's economic expansion is the stone, clay
and glass production industry. Half of the employees in this industry are engaged
in the manufacture of concrete and plaster products. An increase in local construction
has resulted in an increase in the production of cinder blocks and other
building materials. The following products are included: purchased glass products
(example, mirrors)&mdash;Galax, Bassett, Richmond, Martinsville; hydraulic cement&mdash;Fordwick
and Riverton; structural clay (brick and hollow tile)&mdash;Roanoke; pottery
and china (lusterware)&mdash;Abingdon; flower pots and pans&mdash;Richmond; asbestos
(automatic brake linings)&mdash;Winchester; stone products (marble and granite
monumental stones)&mdash;Burkeville, Richmond, Roanoke and Danville; concrete
products&mdash;Roanoke and Richmond; gypsum products&mdash;Plasterco and Norfolk;
lime&mdash;Austinville and Kimballton; mineral wool&mdash;Riverton; soapstone and stone
products&mdash;Schuyler; abrasives&mdash;Petersburg; and mica&mdash;Newport News.</p>

<p>Other manufacturing industries in Virginia include (1) leather and leather
products&mdash;with tanneries at Luray, Bristol, Pearisburg, Buena Vista and Salem;
luggage-making at Petersburg and footwear-making at Lynchburg, Fredericksburg,
Farmville and Halifax; (2) primary metals industry&mdash;with gray-iron foundries
at Newport News, Lynchburg and Radford; (3) fabricated metals industry&mdash;with
the manufacture of structural metal and structural and ornamental products<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
at Richmond, Norfolk, Bristol and Alexandria; pressure vessels at Newport
News; locks at Salem; swimming-pool type atomic reactors at Campbell County
(near Lynchburg), and (4) non-electrical machinery industry&mdash;with hydraulic
turbines, textile wool cards, pulp and papermaking machinery at Newport News,
Crozet, Bristol and Richmond.</p>

<p>Employment in Agriculture&mdash;A persistent trend in Virginia's economic picture
is the continuous decline in agricultural employment, a condition characteristic
of agriculture in the United States in general. Approximately 10% of the total
employment is presently found in agricultural pursuits. Although the demand for
agricultural commodities has increased, the output per worker in agriculture has
increased more rapidly. The greater output has occurred as a result of improved
methods of farming, technological advances and larger agricultural investments.
This situation has resulted also in a greater variety of crops, improved breeds of
livestock, and better control of insects and pests.</p>

<p>In the past twenty years there has been a gradual shift in Virginia's agriculture
from the production of crops to the production of livestock and livestock products.
As a matter of fact, Virginia is a leader in the South in the relative importance of
livestock and livestock products. Poultry and poultry products lead the distribution
list, followed by meat animals (cattle and calves, hogs, sheep and lambs) and
dairy products. Virginia ranks third in the production of turkeys in the United
States and sixth in production of broiler chicks in the United States. Rockingham
County is famous for its turkeys and chickens. "Cut-up chicken" meat, as well
as broilers and eggs, constitutes important poultry products. Culpeper and Loudoun
Counties have the greatest number of milk cows per square mile. Large
manufacturing plants in the southwestern part of Virginia produce evaporated
and condensed milk. Beef cattle are raised in almost every county in Virginia but
the Southwest, the Shenandoah Valley and Northern Virginia are the three chief
regions. In addition to the meat itself, by-products such as soap and fodder are
manufactured and hides and skins are utilized in the making of miscellaneous
articles. Hogs and pigs are found in great numbers in Southampton, Nansemond
and Isle of Wight Counties and sheep and lambs in large numbers in Augusta,
Russell, Rockingham and Highland Counties.</p>

<p>In field crops, tobacco leads the list. One of the nation's largest tobacco producers,
Virginia has four types of tobacco: (1) flue-cured&mdash;the most extensive
one&mdash;grown largely in Pittsylvania, Halifax and Mecklenburg Counties with
Danville and South Boston the chief markets; (2) burley tobacco grown mostly in
the southwest area&mdash;Washington, Scott and Lee Counties&mdash;with Abingdon the
leading market; (3) fire-cured tobacco grown in Appomattox, Charlotte and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Campbell with Lynchburg and Farmville important markets and (4) sun-cured
tobacco grown in central Virginia&mdash;Louisa, Caroline and Hanover Counties&mdash;with
Richmond the largest market in this area.</p>

<p>Virginia ranks first in the amount of peanut yield per acre and third in peanut
production in the United States. The peanut acreage is located in southeast
Virginia&mdash;Southampton, Isle of Wight, Nansemond and Sussex Counties; Suffolk
is often referred to as the "Peanut Capital of the World." Corn is grown
in practically every county with most acreage in Southampton, Loudoun and
Pittsylvania Counties. The growing of wheat, particularly winter wheat, is widespread
also, with Augusta, Rockingham and Loudoun Counties having the greatest
harvest. Irish potatoes are grown extensively on the Eastern Shore (Accomack
and Northampton Counties) and in the Norfolk area. Virginia ranks third in
sweet potato production in the United States and Accomack, Northampton and
Princess Anne Counties are the chief growers of these potatoes. Soy beans are
cultivated in Norfolk, Princess Anne, Accomack, Northumberland and Hanover
Counties. Hay is grown in various parts of Virginia and consists of six types:
clover and timothy hay, lespedeza hay, alfalfa hay, peanut hay, soybean hay and
cowpea hay. Cotton is grown in the southeast, particularly in Southampton,
Greensville, Brunswick and Mecklenburg Counties. Virginia leads all the states
in the production of orchard grass seed. Some oats, barley and buckwheat are
grown but only in small quantities.</p>

<p>Truck farming is extremely important. Lima beans, snap beans, beets, broccoli,
cabbage, cucumbers, sweet corn, kale, onions, green peas, green peppers, spinach,
strawberries, tomatoes and watermelons are grown extensively. The truck farming
region is located primarily in Accomack, Northampton, King and Queen, Nansemond,
Princess Anne and Norfolk Counties. Much of the truck farming crop is
sent to New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, Washington and Atlanta.</p>

<p>In fruit production, apples are first; in total production, apples follow two field
crops, tobacco and peanuts. Virginia ranks fourth in apple production in the
United States. The chief apple producing counties are Frederick, Clarke, Augusta
and Nelson and the types of apples produced are York Imperial, Winesap, Stayman,
Delicious, Grimes Golden, Albemarle Pippin or Yellow Newton, Ben Davis
and Gano, Black Twig, Golden Delicious, Rome Beauty and Jonathan. Peaches
are grown in abundance in Nelson, Albemarle, Frederick, Roanoke, Rockingham
and Botetourt Counties, making Virginia tenth in peach production in the United
States. Pears and grapes are grown on a small scale. In addition to the full-time
agricultural employment, there is much seasonal agricultural employment, particularly
for fruit and truck farming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, although agricultural employment has been surpassed by employment
in government, in manufacturing occupations and in wholesale and retail trade,
the products grown and the livestock raised are numerous and excellent in quality.
Thus, Virginia with approximately 135,000 farms, contributes significantly to the
agricultural economy of the United States.</p>

<p>In addition to employers engaged in government employment, manufacturing
and agriculture, additional groups of employees in Virginia are engaged in a
series of diversified economic activities. Among such occupations are those concerned
with trade, services, public utilities, construction, finance, mining and
forestry and fishing.</p>

<p>Employment in Wholesale and Retail Trade&mdash;Employment in wholesale and
retail trade has increased in Virginia to such an extent that it ranks third, following
government employment and manufacturing employment, in non-agricultural
employment. Approximately 22% of the civilian non-agricultural employees
are engaged in trade. The shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy
has resulted in a greater demand for wholesale and retail goods. During the
decade of the 1950's wholesale and retail trade employment increased its relative
share of total state employment by approximately one-third. The greatest number
of persons in retail trade work in the food trades and in general merchandising.</p>

<p>Employment in Services&mdash;Services industries are located throughout the state;
approximately 11% of the civilian non-agricultural employees are engaged in such
activity. This category includes domestic help and other forms of personalized aid.</p>

<p>Employment in Public Utilities&mdash;Employment in public utilities constitutes
approximately 9% of the total civilian non-agricultural employment. This occupational
group is extremely important because of the key role of transportation,
communication and local utilities in the state. About one-half of these workers
are employed in taxicab service, local transit service, telephone and telegraph
service, radio broadcasting and television service, electric, gas, water and sanitary
service utilities. Half of the workers included in this category consist of railroad
and water transportation workers.</p>

<p>Employment in Construction Activities&mdash;Approximately 7% of the total civilian
non-agricultural employment is concerned with construction. More than three-fourths
of all construction during the past decade has been for private use,
approximately half of this construction involving private residences. The tremendous
increase in the population of Virginia during the past twenty years has
caused the rate of private residential building to be higher than that for the entire
nation. Privately-owned public utility buildings, public highways and private
non-residential buildings rank high in kinds of construction projects undertaken.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Employment in Finance&mdash;Finance, including bank, insurance and real estate
activity, affects all geographical areas of the state but, in terms of numbers, these
activities are primarily located in or near urban centers. Approximately 7% of the
civilian non-agricultural employees are so engaged.</p>

<p>Employment in Mining Operations&mdash;Approximately 2% of the total civilian
non-agricultural employees in Virginia are engaged in mining. More than 80%
of Virginia's mining employment is in bituminous coal which is the chief mining
product of the nation as a whole. Virginia furnishes approximately 3% of the
total annual output of this product in the United States. Such mining is extremely
important in Buchanan and Dickenson Counties where more than half
of all the civilian employees are miners. Pocahontas, Big Stone Gap, Dante and
Tazewell have huge bituminous coal mines. Stone quarrying rates second in
mining employment. Crushed stone granite quarries are found in Roanoke,
Richmond, Fredericksburg, Red Hill and Leesburg and crushed limestone quarries
are found in Kimballton, Riverton, Leesburg, Stephens City and Buchanan.
Employment in crude petroleum, natural gas and in metal mining, which accounts
for one-third of the nation's total mining employment, is less than 3% of Virginia's
total mining employment.</p>

<p>Employment in Forestry and Fisheries&mdash;Current employment in forestry and
fisheries constitutes slightly less than 1% of the total civilian non-agricultural
work force. Commercial fishermen far outnumber the foresters. However, as described
previously, the lumber and lumber products industry, the paper and allied
products industry and the furniture industry which are based upon the forestry
industry have experienced great increases in their employment. Employees engaged
in forest products industries now constitute one-fourth of the total employment
in manufacturing. Although fishermen outnumber foresters at the present
time, the number of fishermen has been decreasing. Nevertheless, the fisheries
supply additional employment to processing and wholesale employees. A few
localities such as Mathews, Northumberland, Lancaster, Gloucester, York and
Middlesex Counties have a comparatively high percentage of their workers engaged
in fisheries.</p>

<p>Employment in Travel Trade&mdash;The number of employees engaged in travel
trade employment is unknown. Two characteristics of this type of employment
should be noted: (1) in addition to full-time employees, there is an indeterminate
number of part-time employees; and (2) employees engaged in travel trade are,
for the most part, seasonal workers. The greatest number of such workers are
found in hotels, motels and other tourist lodgings, in restaurants and cafes, in
gasoline service stations and in recreational and entertainment activities. Approximately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
94% of Virginia's travel trade comes to Virginia via the automobile; out-of-state
tourists constitute about 70% of the travel trade in Virginia. It has been
estimated that about half of these travelers are on vacations and the other half are
mainly on business trips. About half of the vacationers are usually passing through
Virginia on the way to or from specific destinations outside the state. The other
half usually have selected Virginia as their particular destination to visit relatives
or friends, to tour historical and scenic places and to enjoy the recreational attractions
found here. The travel trade has increased considerably during the past few
years. As a direct result of the increase, the number of hotels, motels and other
lodging places in Virginia has likewise rapidly increased. Williamsburg and Virginia
Beach illustrate the singular importance of travel trade in causing widespread
growth in total employment in a community.</p>


<h3><em>Importance of Transportation</em></h3>

<p>The economic activity of any region depends greatly upon its transportation
facilities. Without an efficient transportation system, goods&mdash;either raw materials
or finished products or farm produce&mdash;cannot be moved from one point to another,
workers cannot reach their jobs and consumers cannot reach their markets. Virginia
is particularly fortunate in having a network of key railroads, excellent highways,
deep harbors and modern airports. Trains, buses, trucks, passenger cars, boats,
ocean vessels and aircraft&mdash;all play a basic role in the economic life of the state.</p>

<p>Numerous railroads provide interstate as well as intrastate service: the Richmond,
Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad connects Washington with Richmond;
running over the R.F.&amp;P. tracks and continuing in a north-south direction
between Richmond and the North Carolina border are the Atlantic Coast Line
and Seaboard Air Line railroads; the Southern Railway runs diagonally from
Washington across Virginia to the North Carolina border near Danville, with
another route from West Point through Richmond and Danville; the Atlantic
and Danville Railroad operates between Danville and Norfolk; the Chesapeake
&amp; Ohio Railroad runs diagonally from Washington to Gordonsville where it connects
either in a westerly direction with West Virginia near Covington or in an
easterly direction with Newport News; the Norfolk and Western Railroad operates
in an east-west direction from Norfolk through Lynchburg and Roanoke to
West Virginia; and the Virginian Railway (now a branch of the N. &amp; W.) connects
Suffolk with Roanoke and West Virginia. The Pennsylvania Railroad has
a branch line crossing the Eastern Shore from Maryland to Cape Charles while
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio has a branch through the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia has a very modern system of primary and secondary roads which permit
quick and comfortable motor transportation between urban, suburban and rural
points. In addition, Virginia has within its borders several vital links in the
national system of interstate and defense highways scheduled for final completion
throughout the United States by 1972. In Virginia, the national system involves
one link cutting across the western part of the state in a southwesterly direction
(Interstate Number 81); a second link cutting across the eastern part of the state
in a north-south direction (Number 85 and Number 95) to supercede U. S.
Routes 1 and 301; a third link running east-west between Norfolk, Richmond,
Staunton and the West Virginia border (Number 64); a fourth link running
east-west between northern Virginia near Washington and West Virginia via
Strasburg (Number 66) and a fifth link crossing the southwestern part of the
state in a north-south direction (Number 77). In terms of total designated mileage
of the whole interstate system, Virginia is one of 16 states to have over 1000
miles within its borders. Although most of the interstate system in Virginia will
not be completed for a few more years, some portions of the five Virginia links
are already open for traffic.</p>

<p>A series of bridges, many toll-free, help the growth of transportation. Construction
plans for one of the most difficult water crossings are underway in connection
with a $200,000,000 bridge-tunnel to run 17&frac12; miles across the mouth
of the Chesapeake Bay in the Hampton Roads area. This crossing will run from
Chesapeake Beach near Norfolk to Cape Charles on the Eastern Shore. When
completed in 1964, the bridge-tunnel crossing will replace ferryboats, the only type
of public transportation heretofore available between these points.</p>

<p>Five major commercial air lines serve Virginia: American, Capital, Eastern,
National and Piedmont Lines. In addition to the Washington National Airport
near Alexandria and the Dulles International Airport at Chantilly, which serve
the northern Virginia area, airports contributing to the economic progress of the
state are located at Richmond, Bristol, Danville, Lynchburg, Newport News,
Norfolk-Portsmouth and Roanoke.</p>


<h3><em class="gesperrt">SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>An unusually large number of individuals in the Commonwealth&mdash;civilian and
military&mdash;work in either federal, state or local government employment. In proportion
to the total population of a state, the greatest concentration of federal
government employment within a single state is found in Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>If one considers civilian employees solely, the largest number of employees in
the state is engaged in manufacturing. The number of employees in manufacturing
first surpassed the number of employees in agriculture in the 1940's. The
manufacturing industries which have the largest number of employees are textile,
chemical and chemical products, food and kindred products, and lumber and
wood products; these employees constitute nearly 50% of all workers engaged in
manufacturing.</p>

<p>Other important manufacturing industries include apparel, transportation
equipment, furniture, tobacco, paper and paper products, printing and publishing,
stone, clay and glass production, leather and leather products, primary metals,
fabricated metals, and non-electrical machinery. As Virginia has changed from
a predominantly agricultural state to a predominantly manufacturing state, wholesale
and retail trade has increased proportionately.</p>

<p>Although agriculture is no longer the leading occupation, Virginia has a variety
of important crops and livestock. Poultry and poultry products, meat animals,
dairy products, tobacco, peanuts, corn, winter wheat, sweet potatoes, hay, cotton,
orchard grass seed, truck farming crops and fruit (especially apples, peaches,
strawberries and watermelons) are leading farm products.</p>

<p>Significant numbers of workers in Virginia are engaged in wholesale and retail
trade, services, public utilities, construction (especially construction of private
houses, buildings and public highways), finance, mining (especially bituminous
coal and quarry stone), forestry and fisheries, and travel trade.</p>

<p>An efficient transportation system, consisting of a network of key railroads, excellent
highways, deep harbors and modern airports plays a basic role in the
economic life of the state.</p>

<p>A survey of the major occupations reveals a diversified economic life which
provides the citizens of Virginia with broad opportunities for employment.</p>

Cultural Life</h2>


<p>Culture has been defined as the "training, improvement and refinement
of the mind." Since literature, art, sculpture, architecture, music, drama
and education are factors which influence, as well as reflect, the culture of a
group, a survey of some of the outstanding contributors to these fields will reveal
the broad, cultural heritage of the residents of the Commonwealth.</p>


<h3><em>Literature</em></h3>

<p>Even with the hardships and difficulties facing early settlers in Virginia,
writings in the form of diaries and journals appeared during the colonial period.
George Percy describes his explorations in the New World in "Observations
gathered out of a Discourse of the Southern Colonie in Virginia by the English."
Captain John Smith, the leader of the early colony, is believed to have used both
fact and fiction in his writings. "A True Relation of Virginia," which he wrote
in Virginia and sent to England in an attempt to attract more settlers to the
colony, describes his explorations up the James River. His "Map of Virginia"
was based primarily upon observations which he made while exploring the Chesapeake
Bay region. In 1624, he wrote "The General History of Virginia," which
is considered his literary masterpiece. Under modern literary standards, he would
probably be classed generally as a Romanticist.</p>

<p>William Strachey, who left England as the first secretary of the Virginia Colony
at Jamestown and who experienced in his journey separation of his ship from the
rest of the small fleet, was shipwrecked on the Islands of Bermuda and eventually
arrived at Jamestown. Strachey, who had written some poetry before coming to
America, used his shipwrecked experiences described earlier as background for a
most descriptive letter concerning a tempest at sea. The original title of Strachey's
manuscript was "A True Repertory of the Wrecke, and Redemption of Sir Thomas
Gates" (Gates, Governor of the colony, was also a passenger on the same ship with
Strachey). It is believed by some literary critics that William Shakespeare who
read this letter selected much of its contents as background material for his play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
"The Tempest." Another writer who left a vivid description of his voyage from
England to Virginia is Henry Norwood: his work entitled "A Voyage to Virginia"
is regarded as one of the best realistic, detailed accounts of early voyages to
America.</p>

<p>Only two poets are remembered for their writings in Virginia during the early
period: Richard Rich and George Sandys. Rich utilized his journey from England
to the New World as the basis for his poem, "A Ballad of Virginia," sometimes
entitled "Newes from Virginia." George Sandys, an Oxford gentleman, did not
write concerning Virginia but while he was in Jamestown as the treasurer of the
colony, he completed a most unusual translation of Ovid's "Metamorphoses." An
anonymous elegy found in the "Burwell Papers" is considered one of the finest
literary attempts during the colonial period: entitled "Bacon's Epitaph, Made by
His Man," it eulogizes the courage and steadfastness of purpose of Nathaniel
Bacon who dared to revolt against the autocratic rule of Governor Berkeley and to
lead Bacon's Rebellion. Bacon's untimely death from fever caused many Virginia
settlers to feel, as the author of this elegy felt, that the loss of the champion
of their cause was a severe one.</p>

<p>A different type of writing was furnished by Reverend James Blair, founder of
the College of William and Mary at Williamsburg and president of the second
oldest educational institution in the United States for over fifty years. Reverend
Blair wrote a scholarly article on the organization of churches in Virginia in an
account called "Concerning the Church and Religion." Another minister, Reverend
Hugh Jones, who held the position of professor of mathematics at the College
of William and Mary and who had a strong personal interest in history, wrote
"The Present State of Virginia" in 1724. His writing was characterized by seriousness
of purpose, accuracy and keen observations. He later authored the first English
grammar book written in America.</p>

<p>When Robert Beverley, a native-born Virginian of Middlesex County, was
visiting in London, he was asked by a London bookdealer to review a manuscript
which had been submitted concerning the American colonies. Beverley disagreed
with much of the information included in the manuscript and decided to write
a book himself on Virginia. Consequently, he wrote "The History of Virginia."
This book was considered such enjoyable reading that it was later published in
French. Robert Beverley is considered the first Virginia formal history author.</p>

<p>The man whose writings are usually classified as the best writings in Virginia
before the Revolutionary Period was William Byrd II. He was born on a plantation
along the James River and was sent to England for his education at the age
of ten. He traveled in Holland, studied law and was admitted to the bar at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
age of twenty-one. After returning to Virginia, he was elected to the Virginia
Assembly. He built a beautiful home, Westover, became a leading figure in
politics and in Virginia society and instituted a personal library in his home which
exceeded 3,000 volumes, the largest library in the colonies. He returned to England
as the legal representative of the Virginia Assembly where he enjoyed the
companionship of the socially elite in England. When his father died, he returned
to Virginia and inherited 25,000 acres, political supremacy and a high place in
social circles. Byrd's writings did not appear publicly until more than two hundred
years after his death. Three papers are believed to be his best literary achievements:
"The History of the Dividing Line" (concerning the boundary line established
between Virginia and North Carolina), "A Progress to the Mines" (concerning
a journey to some iron mines) and "A Journey to the Land of Eden"
(concerning a journey to the Dismal Swamp area). These chronicles were combined
and included in the "Westover Manuscripts." Notes from Byrd's personal
diary, which was kept in code and later translated by Mrs. Marion Tingling, have
been published and reveal many human-interest incidents in his eventful life.</p>

<p>Another colonial Virginia historian is Reverend William Stith. He used colonial
records, personal papers of his uncle, Sir John Randolph, London Company
official records and material available in the Byrd Library to write a most comprehensive
history of Virginia entitled "The History of Virginia from the First
Settlement to the Dissolution of the London Company." Although it has been
criticized for its extreme length and detailedness, this history is a scholarly, authoritative
source still used by researchers for knowledge of this period of history.</p>

<p>As the colonists in America were beginning to rebel against the mother country,
were gradually learning the feeling of freedom and democracy and were becoming
more settled in their mode of living, their interests changed from problems of
existence to serious thoughts concerning government, rights of individuals and
political theories. The changing thoughts of the colonists were reflected in the
type of writings which began to appear prior to the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>George Washington, who is usually remembered foremost as the first President
of the United States and as the great military leader of the Revolutionary War,
must not be overlooked in the literary field. Washington left numerous addresses,
official documents, orders and letters of various types. However, one of his finest
literary works is a personal diary kept by him, at the age of sixteen, while on a
surveying trip in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. It has become famous for
its human quality and is simply named, "Journey over the Mountains, 1748."
Washington's acceptance as Commander-in-chief of the United States Army, his
"Farewell Speech" to the soldiers at the end of the war, his acceptance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Presidency and his "Farewell Address"&mdash;all reveal the literary qualities which he
possessed.</p>

<p>Patrick Henry of Hanover County spoke in dramatic fashion about ideas and
ideals which abounded in the minds of many other Americans. Henry's arguments
in the "Parsons' Case," his authorship of the Virginia Resolutions prefaced
by his famous "Caesar-Brutus" Speech, his pleading address at the Continental
Congress for the arming of Virginia and his famous "Give me Liberty or Death"
Speech&mdash;all these words, written or spoken, are recorded for posterity in the literature
of the times.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson, the "Monticello Wizard" of multi-talents, made considerable
contributions to the historical, social and educational fields. His "A Summary
View of the Rights of British America," although considered radical in part, was
a pamphlet which brought widespread attention to the important issues of allegiance
and natural rights. Jefferson's language predominates in the Declaration
of Independence, and, as some authors of history and of literature have asserted,
Jefferson's fame would have been international from this one document alone
even if he had died at the conclusion of this task. Jefferson rated his "Act for
Religious Freedom in Virginia" as one of the three greatest personal achievements
of his lifetime. After Jefferson retired to his home at Monticello upon the completion
of his Governorship, he wrote his famous "Notes on Virginia."</p>

<p>George Mason, a native of Fairfax County, used a literary style that is described
as frank often to the point of bluntness, clear, democratic and unassuming yet
distinguished. An illustration of this type of writing is a group of resolutions
called the "Fairfax Resolves"&mdash;so-called because they were presented at a meeting
in Fairfax County. George Mason was selected later at the Virginia State Constitutional
Convention at Williamsburg to pen a declaration of aims for a State
constitution. The Virginia Bill of Rights which he proceeded to describe consists
of the fundamental rights of man which he believed must be guaranteed if happiness
and peace are to be attained. These ideas were considered so necessary to
mankind that eventually they were drawn upon for the Bill of Rights in the
United States Constitution and Bills of Rights in various other State constitutions.
Thus, the influence of George Mason of Gunston Hall will be forever enshrined
in the literary field as well as in the political field.</p>

<p>Richard Henry Lee of Westmoreland County is included in a survey of literary
contributors because of his carefully worded public addresses, his well-written
"Leedstown Resolutions" and his introduction of the famous resolution "that these
united Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States ..." at
the Philadelphia convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Excellent information about life on a Southern plantation is found in "The
Journal of Philip Vickers Fithian." This manuscript was written in the form of a
one-year diary and includes a description of the life of Philip Fithian as a tutor
to the children of Robert Carter at Nomini Hall, Westmoreland County. His
various letters and a second diary describing a mission tour in Virginia taken after
he had become a Presbyterian minister also make enjoyable reading. His untimely
death at the age of twenty-eight while he was working as a chaplain in a Revolutionary
Army camp ended a literary career which had begun most successfully.</p>

<p>Besides his political career, James Madison developed persuasive writing techniques
as illustrated in his contributions to "The Federalist" papers. He wrote
twenty articles in an effort to encourage ratification of the United States Constitution.
"The Federalist" remains the greatest single written influence which persuaded
Americans who were doubtful about the Constitution to decide finally in
favor of it. Another example of his written powers of persuasion is "A Memorial
and Remonstrance to the Virginia General Assembly" wherein he successfully
defeated a proposal to provide state support for the teaching of religion in Virginia.
He was an ardent believer in the separation of church and state. The voluminous,
lucid notes which Madison recorded during the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention
are still the sole source of detailed, accurate information about this historical
meeting.</p>

<p>St. George Tucker, a student and later a law professor at William and Mary
College and a Virginia judge, wrote two lyrical poems, "Resignation" and "Days
of My Youth," in addition to an annotated edition of Blackstone's "Commentaries"
consisting of five volumes. Principles of government and of the Federal
Constitution included in the appendix of these works are regarded as legally
significant. Tucker showed his versatility by writing drama and political satires
as well as poetry. He is probably remembered best in literary circles for "A Dissertation
on Slavery: With a Proposal For the Gradual Abolition of It in the
State of Virginia."</p>

<p>John Taylor, a statesman, who served in the House of Delegates and in the
United States Senate, wrote many economic and political treatises. His most
widely-read work was "An Inquiry into the Principles and Policy of the Government
of the United States." His strong advocacy of Jefferson's agrarian program
gained him a reading audience of farmers as well as statesmen.</p>

<p>John Marshall, a famous Virginian in the federal judiciary, published in 1804-1807
a five-volume scholarly biography of George Washington: "The Life of
George Washington."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Mason Locke Weems, often called "Parson" Weems, was a native of Maryland
who married a Virginian and spent much of his life in Virginia. In 1800, he
published "A History of the Life and Death, Virtues and Exploits of General
George Washington, With Curious Anecdotes Equally Honorable to Himself
and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen." He combined fact and fiction at his
own discretion and had a highly imaginative mind. He is believed to have introduced
the method of anecdote writing; the cherry tree episode and the throwing
of the Spanish dollar across the Rappahannock were included in his biography of
Washington. He later wrote biographies of Francis Marion, Benjamin Franklin
and William Penn. Weem's biographies are enjoyable reading rather than accurate
accounts of the lives of these individuals.</p>

<p>Henry Lee, father of Robert E. Lee and widely known as "Light Horse Harry"
Lee, was selected as the individual to deliver the funeral oration of George
Washington. His "Tribute to Washington" is a literary masterpiece which included
the oft-quoted lines, in referring to Washington, as "first in war, first in
peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen." Later, during his imprisonment
for an unpaid debt, he wrote "Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department."</p>

<p>James McClurg, a delegate from Virginia to the Philadelphia Constitutional
Convention, enjoyed writing light verse. "The Belles of Williamsburg" illustrates
his type of poetry.</p>

<p>Although William Wirt is usually associated with law, his name is also associated
with literature. His best known work is "The Letters of a British Spy" in
which he included the oratorical ability of the blind Presbyterian evangelist,
James Waddell. Wirt published two series of essays, called "The Rainbow" and
"The Old Bachelor." He also wrote a biography, titled "Sketches of the Life and
Character of Patrick Henry," which has been both favorably and unfavorably
criticized.</p>

<p>An individual whose original remarks, both written and oral, have been classified
as literarily significant is the famous political leader, John Randolph of
Roanoke. He is believed to have symbolized the turning-point of the minds of
Virginians from democratic and international viewpoints to aristocratic and states
rights' beliefs. His stepfather was St. George Tucker who influenced him in his
youth to become intellectually acquainted through reading with some of the great
writers of the world: Shakespeare, Voltaire, Pope and Goldsmith. In the literary
field, he became noted for his clever, though often sarcastic, epigrams, particularly
those referring to political leaders of the times. Although he himself did not publish
any material, his remarks have been recorded and were later printed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
two-volume biography, entitled "John Randolph of Roanoke 1773-1833" by
William Cabell Bruce.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Beverly Tucker was the half-brother of John Randolph of Roanoke
and the son of St. George Tucker. Born in Chesterfield County, he became a
lawyer, a judge and a professor of law at William and Mary College. Although
he was never able to attain economically and socially this high planter type of
social status, he taught the necessity of an aristocracy. He expounded the doctrine
of secession, defended slavery in spite of his father's energetic campaign against
slavery and disliked practically everything outside of Virginia. In 1836, he wrote
"The Partisan Leader" under the assumed name of Edward William Sidney.
Since he strongly disliked Martin Van Buren, he wrote this book in direct opposition
to Van Buren. He placed the time of the story as 1856 and then proceeded
to describe the happenings of a "dictatorship" which had been established by Van
Buren and the eventual secession of the Southern states from the Union with a
civil war as the result. Peculiarly enough, this book was reprinted in 1861 as a
propaganda technique by both the North and the South: the North used it as
an illustration that the theory of secession had been planned and discussed for
years in the South and the South used it as an illustration that the theory of
secession had been justified and accepted for years. Two major literary works of
Tucker are "A Discourse on the Importance of the Study of Political Science"
and "The Principles of Pleading."</p>

<p>Francis Walker Gilmer, a native of Albemarle County and a brilliant student
at William and Mary where he prepared himself for a law career, wrote an anonymous
volume entitled "Sketches of American Orators." His "Sketches, Essays
and Translations" were published posthumously.</p>

<p>William Alexander Caruthers was a medical doctor who enjoyed writing. His
most well-known book is "The Knights of the Horse-Shoe; a Traditional Tale of
the Cocked Hat Gentry in the Old Dominion." He also wrote "The Kentuckian
in New-York, or the Adventures of Three Southerners," "The Cavaliers of Virginia,
or the Recluse of Jamestown" and "An Historical Romance of the Old
Dominion."</p>

<p>The greatest literary genius of Virginia is generally considered to be Edgar
Allan Poe. Although born in Boston, Poe was adopted just prior to his third
birthday by the John Allan family of Richmond. He is said to have once remarked
to a friend: "I am a Virginian. At least I call myself one." His early years
were spent in Richmond, and his early education was acquired in Richmond.
Upon the death of his stepmother, his stepfather arranged to get him appointed
to West Point. He had published two sets of poems before he was twenty:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
"Tamerlane and Other Poems" and "Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems."
After he had been dismissed from West Point one year later, he decided to dedicate
his life to writing. His third volume of poetry entitled "Poems" was published
by the age of twenty-two. Poe spent the rest of his life combatting mental sickness,
poverty and loneliness. At the age of twenty-four, he began writing prose
work. He created the modern short story, the detective story and wrote critical
essays for the Southern Literary Messenger which thrived through his writings.
He became editor of this publication in 1835. Other works written by Poe include
"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym," "Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque,"
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue and The Man That Was Used Up,"
"Tales," "The Raven and Other Poems" and "Eureka: A Prose Poem." He died
at the age of forty, the greatest literary purist the country had yet produced.</p>

<p>Another writer who contributed much to the Southern Literary Messenger was
Philip Pendleton Cooke of Martinsburg, Virginia (now West Virginia). Although
a lawyer by career, he spent much of his time writing. His best-liked poem is
"Florence Vane," a memorial lyric. He wrote several poems and prose during his
comparatively short life of thirty-three years.</p>

<p>A survey of outstanding Virginia authors of the Mid-Nineteenth Century
Period would not be complete without mentioning the name of Matthew Fontaine
Maury who is not only recognized for his broad knowledge of science and his
unique ability of mapping winds and ocean currents but also for his numerous
articles on scientific information. His "Physical Geography of the Sea" (1855)
is the first textbook written on modern oceanography and two other books, a
"Manual of Geography" and "Physical Geography," were well received by the
public.</p>

<p>Robert E. Lee became famous in a literary sense for his sincere, humble,
cleverly worded letters, particularly those concerning his declining the command
of the Federal army, his acceptance of the command of the Virginia forces, his
farewell to his Confederate colleagues at the end of the War between the States
and his acceptance of the Presidency of Washington College after that war.</p>

<p>More books have been written about the period of the War between the States
than about any other similar period in United States history. One writer who
kept a detailed daily account of personal happenings from May 1861 to May 1865
was Judith W. McGuire of Richmond. Her "Diary of a Southern Refugee,
During the War, by a Lady of Virginia" was written originally for the benefit of
younger members of the family who at that time were not old enough to understand
what was happening but would presumably appreciate a first-hand report
when they were older. Mrs. McGuire's husband was a chaplain in the Officers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Hospital in Richmond, and she served as a nurse in Richmond after fleeing from
their home in Alexandria. She later authored a brief biography of Lee, entitled
"General Robert E. Lee, the Christian Soldier."</p>

<p>Individuals today are still writing biographies about military leaders who participated
in the War between the States. The first important biography of "Stonewall"
Jackson, however, was written by an army chaplain, Robert Lewis Dabney.
Although he had written several articles on theology and religion, his most remembered
work is "Life and Campaigns of Lieutenant-General Thomas J. Jackson."
Since Dabney served as a Major on Jackson's staff, he had access to first-hand
information and personal observations of Jackson and proceeded to utilize such
information advantageously.</p>

<p>John Reuben Thompson, who was editor of the Southern Literary Messenger
from 1847 until 1860, was an author and a poet. He wrote a description of his
travels in Europe entitled "Across the Atlantic," but his literary reputation was
based upon his pro-Confederate articles and his war poems.</p>

<p>George William Bagby was an essayist and humorist of Buckingham County.
He succeeded Thompson as editor of the Southern Literary Messenger. Although
educated as a doctor, he preferred writing for a career; six years after his graduation,
he pursued his literary interest. He contributed several articles to leading
magazines of the times: Harper's, Appleton's, Lippincott's, and Putnam's. His
sketches of everyday living are characterized by his human interest touch and his
unique technique of realism at that time. His lofty idealism was supplemented
by the ability to admit weaknesses as well as strength of whatever or whomever
he was discussing. The work which is usually associated with his name is "The
Old Virginia Gentleman," a series of talks which he delivered to raise money
for historical societies of the state. He was an ardent devotee of the Commonwealth
and his writings exemplify this affectionate feeling.</p>

<p>James Barron Hope, a native of Norfolk, is another poet who also contributed
newspaper articles. He published "Leoni de Monote and Other Poems," "A
Collection of Poems" and "An Elegaic Ode," but his most famous poem was
created in 1882 when he wrote "Arms and the Man: A Metrical Address" upon
the invitation of Congress in honor of the 100th anniversary of the surrender
of Cornwallis at Yorktown. He also wrote a novel, "Under the Empire," and
numerous stories for children.</p>

<p>An author who was as strongly a romanticist as George Bagby was a realist was
John Esten Cooke. He was a native of Winchester and a brother of Philip P.
Cooke. He exemplifies the many Virginians who&mdash;even after the Confederacy
had ended, the plantation system had been transplanted by the merchant class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
system and the States' Rights theory had dissolved into a type of nationalism&mdash;still
clung to the idea of rebuilding or establishing another similar social system in
the late 1880's. Cooke used his literary talents to glorify the plantation type of
living and the heroic, military deeds of the war itself. He is sometimes regarded
as an author who looked "backward" rather than at the present or toward the
future. By the age of twenty-four, Cooke had completed and had published a
two-volume novel, "The Virginia Comedians," a historical romance, "Leather
Stocking and Silk" and another historical, romantic novel, "The Youth of Jefferson."
He also contributed several newspaper and periodical articles. His biography,
"Life of Stonewall Jackson," was later increased in scope and published
under the new title, "Surry of Eagle's-Nest." He wrote novels with extreme
rapidity and, consequently, he did not take time for literary refinement as many
authors do. His other written works include "Virginia: A History of the People,"
"Stories of the Old Dominion," "Mohun" and "The Virginia Bohemians." However,
he is usually considered the outstanding historical novelist and biographer
of the period directly following the War between the States.</p>

<p>Moncure Daniel Conway, a native of Stafford County, may be classified as a
writer for the minority. He used forceful language to arouse interest in reforms
in which only a minority of the Virginians believed at the time. He wrote a
pamphlet in 1850 entitled "Free Schools in Virginia" in which he voiced a strong
appeal for public education. He became a minister and used the pulpit as a place
to advocate anti-slavery movements to such an extent that he was dismissed from
his position as pastor of the Unitarian Church in Washington. He wrote many
short articles in pamphlet form about anti-slaveryism. In 1861, he published a
volume of similar information entitled, "The Rejected Stone, by a Native of
Virginia." He spent the rest of his life writing more than seventy books and
traveling in Europe where he made his home in England. Among his best-known
books are "Life of Thomas Paine," "Omitted Chapters of History: Disclosed in
the Life and Papers of Edmund Randolph," "George Washington and Mount
Vernon" and "Barons of the Potomac and the Rappahannock."</p>

<p>Father Abram Joseph Ryan of Norfolk is considered the greatest Virginia poet
of the period immediately following the War between the States. He is often
referred to as the "Laureate of the South." Using his pen name, "Moina," he
specialized in war lyrics which were soon memorized by Southerners in general.
His two most popular poems were "The Conquered Banner" and "Sword of
Robert E. Lee."</p>

<p>Virginius Dabney, a native of Gloucester County, was an ex-lawyer who taught
and wrote. His most famous novel was "The Story of Don Miff" which described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the life of the plantation owners prior to the War between the States. His last
novel before his death was "Gold That Did Not Glitter."</p>

<p>Father John Banister Tabb was a native of Amelia County who became a
personal friend of the poet, Sidney Lanier. His "Poems," "Lyrics," "Child Verse"
and "Later Lyrics" are still popular reading for poetry-lovers.</p>

<p>Christopher P. Cranch should be mentioned for his translation of Virgil's
"Aeneid" into English in 1875. Like George Sandys who translated Ovid's
"Metamorphoses," Cranch's translation promoted better understanding of the
"Aeneid" on the part of Americans.</p>

<p>Thomas Nelson Page, a native of Hanover County, became famous from a
literary viewpoint when he published in 1887 six stories in a book called "In Ole
Virginia." The first story is called "Marse Chan," and is written in Negro dialect.
Page, like John Cooke, wrote pleasingly, though not entirely accurately, about
conditions in the South after the War between the States. His writings served
as a tonic to the depressed and hard-struggling Virginians who were striving to
rebuild their state to its former prosperous status. Page also wrote "Two Little
Confederates" for juvenile reading and non-fiction articles as well as fiction ones.
Some of the non-fiction ones include "The Old Dominion: Her Making and Her
Manners," "The Old South" and "Robert E. Lee: Man and Soldier."</p>

<p>Mary Johnston, born at Buchanan, is sometimes classified as a transitional
writer as she wrote at the end of the Nineteenth Century and also at the beginning
of the Twentieth Century. She is considered a writer of historical realism
although originally she began writing as a romanticist. Her writings included "To
Have and To Hold," "Prisoner of Hope," "Cease Firing," "The Long Roll,"
"The Slave Ship," "The Great Valley," "Hagar," "Silver Cross," "Croatan,"
"Michael Forth" and "The Exile." She lived near Warm Springs when she wrote
the last six books, and she utilized the style of mysticism in these works. Her style
was a great contrast to the earlier hero-worshiping and glorification of ante-bellum
days in Virginia.</p>

<p>John Fox, Jr. of Big Stone Gap used the Cumberland Mountain residents for
the characters of his novel, "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine." A visitor to Bound
Gap may view the countryside described in this book and still see the spot where
the evergreen tree, reputed to be the original Lonesome Pine, stood. The activities
of the mountain folk themselves and his own mining experiences in West Virginia
mines furnished John Fox, Jr., with most of his plot sequences. His other two
most well-known novels are "The Kentuckians" and "The Little Shepherd of
Kingdom Come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Virginia Hawes Terhune, a native of Dennisville, Amelia County, and mother
of Albert Payson Terhune, used the nom-de-plume of "Marian Harland." She
wrote newspaper articles about household activities and travel books, fiction books
and a famous cookbook. Her last book was "The Carringtons of High Hill."</p>

<p>William Cabell Bruce, a native of Charlotte County, was a distinguished author
who was editor of the "University of Virginia Magazine" and who won the
Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1918. His prize-winning biography was "Benjamin
Franklin, Self-Revealed."</p>

<p>Ellen Glasgow, a native of Richmond, was one of the most distinguished modern
American novelists. She wrote her first novel at the age of eighteen and chose
this type of work for her career. In an era of sentimental and romantic writing,
she dared to inject severe realism. She has sometimes been characterized as a
romantic realist having no hesitation in frankly portraying weaknesses as well as
the strength of her beloved Virginia. Her novels depicted scenes of the South
and featured a broad background, rather than a comparatively small segment of
people or a few isolated places. In her novels, Miss Glasgow presents a social
history of Virginia from about 1851 to 1945. Her writings include "The Voice
of the People," "The Battle-Ground," "The Deliverance," "The Romance of a
Plain Man," "The Miller of Old Church," "Virginia," "Life of Gabriella,"
"Barren Ground," "The Romantic Comedians," "They Stooped to Folly," "The
Sheltered Life," "Vein of Iron" and "In This Our Life." She published her first
two volumes anonymously: "The Descendant" and "Phases of an Inferior Planet."
Her last novel, "In This Our Life," won the Pulitzer Prize in 1942.</p>

<p>Another native of Richmond, James Branch Cabell, was the author of thirty
books classified as satirical fiction and essays. He had a tremendous imagination
which, coupled with his constant use of symbolism and ridicule, resulted in a
most unusual style of writing: literature of disillusionment. In eighteen volumes
he created an imaginary land of Poictesme and traced the "Biography of Don
Manuel." After Cabell finished this lengthy biography, he omitted the name,
James, from his name and simply used the name, Branch Cabell. An autobiography,
"These Restless Heads," was signed in this manner. Later he wrote autobiographical
essays entitled "Quiet, Please" and once more began to use his full
name, James Branch Cabell.</p>

<p>Douglas Southall Freeman, a native of Lynchburg, is considered the greatest
Virginian biographer. He was editor of the Richmond "News-Leader" from 1915
to 1949. In 1935, Dr. Freeman won the Pulitzer Prize for his four-volume biography,
"R. E. Lee." He also wrote a supplement of three volumes, entitled "Lee's
Lieutenants," which was exceptionally well received. He wrote "The South to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Posterity" and was in the process of completing the sixth volume of his biography
of "George Washington" at the time of his death in 1953. In this same year
another Virginian, David J. Mays, won the Pulitzer Prize for the biography,
"Edmund Pendleton, 1721-1803."</p>

<p>Emily Clark, a native of Richmond, founded and edited a literary, monthly
magazine entitled "Reviewer." Her most well-known work is "Innocence Abroad,"
written in 1931. Craddock Edmunds, a native of Halifax, specialized in poetry
with such titles as "Ulysses and Other Poems," "Mass," "Geese Are Swan,"
"Poems," "The Renaissance" and "Five Men."</p>

<p>Virginius Dabney, grandson of the earlier author, Virginius Dabney, was born
at Lexington. He is known for outstanding editorial writing for the Richmond
"Times-Dispatch" and was awarded the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for this field of literature.
In addition to his editorials, he also wrote "Liberalism in the South" and
"Below the Potomac."</p>

<p>Julian R. Meade, a native of Danville, became a literary figure through publication
of his book entitled, "I Live in Virginia." Since his style was characterized
by romanticism combined with realism, this book caused much controversy among
its local readers. Having horticulture as an avocation, Meade wrote a witty yet
sarcastic book on gardening called "Adam's Profession and Its Conquest by Eve"
and a novel on gardening called "Bouquets and Bitters."</p>

<p>Clifford Dowdey, a native of Richmond, started his literary career as an editorial
writer in New York City. One of his first best sellers was "Bugles Blow No
More" which resulted in his being awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. As he
traveled throughout the United States, he wrote "Gamble's Hundred," "Sing for
a Penny," "Tidewater," "Where My Love Sleeps," "Experiment in Rebellion"
and "Weep for My Brother." He also wrote a book, "The Land They Fought
For: The Story of the South as the Confederacy, 1831-1865."</p>

<p>It is difficult to select the outstanding writers of a contemporary period because
of the effect of the passage of time, the varied reaction of the reading public, and
the detailed factors included in a keen analysis of types of literature. Numerous
current Virginians have been accepted by the reading public with some of the
best known being Dr. Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker, Dr. Robert Douthat
Meade, Agnes Rothery, Arthur Kyle Davis, Jr., John Wayland, Thomas T.
Waterman, Mary Thurman Pyle, Murrell Edmunds, John H. Gwathmey, Leigh
Hanes, M. Clifford Harrison, Helen Jones Campbell, Robert Selph Henry,
Colonel William A. Couper and Dr. Charles Turner.</p>

<p>The "Commonwealth" Magazine, published monthly by the Virginia State
Chamber of Commerce, the "Virginia and the Virginia County" Magazine, published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
monthly by the League of Virginia Counties and the "Virginia Cavalcade"
Magazine, published quarterly by the Virginia State Library furnish excellent
articles on domestic problems and progress in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The Virginia State Library located in Richmond was founded for the free use
of the residents of Virginia as a general library with primary emphasis upon reference
service. The library houses an extensive collection of books, maps, public
documents, private papers and manuscripts in a variety of subject matter areas.
The State Library also provides an interlibrary loan plan and includes Administration,
Publication, General Library, Archives, Extension and Historical Divisions.
The present library structure was dedicated in 1941 and cost one and one-half
million dollars. It includes a photographic laboratory, a work facility for
restoring rare books and worn manuscripts, a facility for cleaning and fumigating
reading materials, individual study nooks and rooms, an attractive entrance hall
with a mural and several display cases as well as the typical reading rooms, offices,
and book stacks. The Virginia State Library is well-equipped staff-wise and
facility-wise for rendering unusual cultural services for the Commonwealth.</p>


<h3><em>Art and Sculpture</em></h3>

<p>Art&mdash;The early colonists found little time for engaging in the arts. Nevertheless,
a beginning in art was made. For example, John White (sometimes referred
to as Johannes Wyth), the grandfather of Virginia Dare, made water color
sketches portraying the life of the native Indians in the area.</p>

<p>Various handicrafts were pursued from time to time. When Sir Christopher
Newport came to Virginia, he included in his group some Polish and Dutch glassmakers.
When the terrible winter of 1610 caused the death of a majority of the
colonists at Jamestown, glassmaking came temporarily to an end. Another early
attempt was the making of glass beads as a bartering item for the Indians, but the
massacre of 1622 ended these ventures. Other handicrafts generally introduced
in the colony included weaving, potterymaking, wigmaking, tanning, pewter
making and cobbling. Williamsburg eventually became the center of such handicrafts.</p>

<p>In the Eighteenth Century, numerous European artists visited America. As
they toured from one colony to another, they often made prolonged visits in
communities where their artistic talents were appreciated. Not only did they
sometimes sell their personal paintings, but they were often hired to paint important
personages in such communities and members of individual families. In
1734, Charles Bridges, an English artist, arrived in Williamsburg: his reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for portrait painting spread rapidly after he had painted portraits of the children
of William Byrd II. He also painted a picture of Reverend James Blair, the first
President of the College of William and Mary.</p>

<p>John Wollaston, Jr., another British artist, came to Williamsburg and earned
the title, "The Almond-Eyed Artist," because he painted the eyes of his subjects
with a peculiar slant toward the nose. Portraits of Betty Washington Lewis,
sister of George Washington, and her husband, Colonel Fielding Lewis, and of
Lawrence Washington, half-brother of George Washington were drawn by

<p>In 1785, Jean Antoine Houdon, a distinguished French sculptor, arrived
at Mount Vernon to fulfill a commission of the Virginia State Legislature to
make a statue of George Washington. After a year of personal observation of
Washington at Mount Vernon and an analysis of Washington's facial characteristics,
he created a life mask of Washington's face and made specific measurements
of his body. Washington was 53 years old at this time and was six feet, two
inches in height. Houdon then returned to France and proceeded to carve a
Carrara marble statue of his subject. In 1796, the "Figure of George Washington"
was placed beneath the dome of the rotunda of the State Capitol. This statue
portrays Washington dressed in military uniform with small battle weapons and
a plowshare located at his feet and with his left arm on a fasces (a bundle of rods
enclosing an ax to symbolize power or authority). This particular pose is believed
to have been selected by Houdon after he had observed Washington in a bargaining
bout for a yoke of oxen. When Washington heard what he considered an
outrageous price requested for the oxen, he exclaimed loudly his opinion of this
proposal with his arm outstretched on a fence post. Houdon is said to have witnessed
this incident and to have tried immediately to capture this pose of Washington's
facial characteristics for his statue. A statue of LaFayette sculptured by
Houdon is also included in one of the niches in the encircling wall of the rotunda
section and a bust of Washington by Houdon is also located at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>After Washington had become a member of the Masonic Lodge in Alexandria,
the lodge members asked William Williams, a New Yorker, to paint Washington
"as he is." The pastel portrait which he painted caused much controversy: some
individuals considered it cruel and unartistic, others considered it realistic and
the only true likeness of Washington. Williams had even included the scars on
Washington's face which were remnants of a scarlet fever siege which Washington
had endured. This portrait is in the Masonic Museum in the Masonic Temple
Lodge in Alexandria. Williams also made a portrait of "Light Horse Harry" Lee,
but this one did not cause controversy as did the one of Washington.</p>

<p>After the Revolutionary War had ended in America, the artists of Virginia and
the other ex-colonies of England were influenced by classicism in art in Europe.
Many of America's foremost artists of this time traveled to Europe to study this
new art movement and were taught by Benjamin West who had set up a school
in London. One of his best known students was Charles Willson Peale, who
painted a full-length portrait of William Pitt. Peale came to Virginia and soon
became well known for his individual and group portraits, silhouettes and miniatures
of outstanding Virginians. His portraits of William Henry Harrison and of
Lafayette are considered artistic gems. Peale's most famous portrait is his painting
of George Washington, clothed in the military garb of a colonel.</p>

<p>Gilbert Stuart is usually considered the finest American painter of the post-Colonial
period. Important Virginians whom he painted were George Washington,
Colonel John Tayloe, John Randolph of Roanoke and James and Dolly
Madison. Most of his paintings were done at Washington soon after it became
the national capital city.</p>

<p>In 1807, a Frenchman, Julien F. de Saint-Memin, visited Richmond for approximately
one year. He used a machine called a physionotrace which enabled
him to make profile drawing in white chalk and in crayon. He acquired the technique
of getting these drawings etched on copper plates which allowed him to
make fine miniature engravings. One of his most famous art works is an etched
view of the waterfront at Richmond.</p>

<p>Benjamin West Clinedinst, a native of Woodstock, is particularly remembered
by Virginians for his great panorama painting of the Battle of New Market. Since
he had received his education at the Virginia Military Institute, he had a very
strong esprit de corps for this battle in which 257 cadets from V. M. I, helped
General John Breckinridge at the cost of ten students killed and forty-seven
wounded. Over the rostrum of the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hall at the Virginia
Military Institute is a huge canvas painting by Clinedinst portraying a
panorama of the charge of the cadet corps at this historic Battle of New Market.
In addition to his portrait painting, Clinedinst furnished numerous book and
magazine illustrations.</p>

<p>Sculpture&mdash;Sculpture did not really develop fully in Virginia until the Nineteenth
Century. Alexander Galt of Norfolk was one of the earliest sculptors in
this region. Although he died before his artistic ability had been fully developed,
his memorable life-size white marble figure of Thomas Jefferson is located inside
the Rotunda at the University of Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1865, Edward Virginius Valentine, a native of Richmond who had traveled
and studied throughout Europe, came back to his home town. He created not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
great sculptures but many unusual sculptures: the bronze figure of General Hugh
Mercer in Fredericksburg, a bronze bust of Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury
located in the Virginia State Library at Richmond, a bust of John Jasper, a Negro
preacher, located in the Sixth Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Richmond, a marble
statue of Thomas Jefferson in the lobby of a Richmond hotel, an ornate bronze
statue of Jefferson Davis in a speaking position on Monument Avenue in Richmond
and a bronze statue of "Stonewall" Jackson at the grave of "Stonewall"
Jackson in the Lexington Presbyterian Cemetery. At Washington and Lee University
located in Lexington is the Lee Memorial Chapel. Behind the altar in this
chapel is an internationally famous white marble, recumbent "Figure of Lee"
which Valentine created. Because of its recumbent position, symbolic of General
Lee resting on a battlefield cot, this statue is considered most unique. For thirty
years, Valentine used the original carriage house of the Mann S. Valentine House
in Richmond as an art studio. When the Valentine House was acquired by the
City of Richmond and was finally opened to the public for visitation, many of
Valentine's original sculptures were grouped in the collection, including the
plaster cast of his famous recumbent statue of Robert E. Lee.</p>

<p>Sir Moses Ezekiel, a sculptor and a soldier, was a native Virginian, but he
studied and maintained his residence abroad for most of his life. However, there
are many examples of his fine artistic talent in his native state. In the center of
the Rotunda at the University of Virginia is a bronze figure of Thomas Jefferson
placed upon a pedestal which is in the shape of the Liberty Bell; thus, the work
of Sir Ezekiel is called the Liberty Bell Statue of Thomas Jefferson. Ezekiel has
another bronze statue on the same campus known as the Statue of Homer which
portrays a boy with a lyre sitting against the knee of Homer. Major John Warwick
Daniel was a United States Senator from Virginia who was noted for his
great oratorical ability. After he was severely wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness,
he became a cripple and was nicknamed "The Lame Lion of Lynchburg."
Ezekiel designed a statue located at Lynchburg in honor of Major Daniel which
shows him seated and holding a crutch. Ezekiel, like Clinedinst, was a cadet at
the Virginia Military Institute during the War between the States and was
present at the Battle of New Market in which the V. M. I. Cadets participated.
In front of the Nichols Engineering Hall at the Virginia Military Institute is a
bronze seated figure of "Virginia Mourning Her Dead," known also as the "New
Market Monument." Ezekiel is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, not far
from the "Confederate Memorial" monument of bronze which he created.</p>

<p>William Ludwell Sheppard, a sculptor, created numerous well-known statues,
including a bronze one of Governor William Smith located on the north side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Capitol Square in Richmond, "The Color-Bearer," a bronze haut-relief, the
"Soldiers' and Sailors'" Monument and the Statue of General A. P. Hill&mdash;all
located in Richmond.</p>

<p>Augustus Lukeman, a Richmonder who later moved to New York City, made
the portrait bust of Jefferson Davis in the United States Capitol. A Norfolk
native, William Couper, molded a bronze statue of Captain John Smith at Jamestown
and a bronze statue of Dr. Hunter H. McGuire, a brilliant Winchester
doctor, on the north side of Capitol Square in Richmond. He also designed a
Norfolk Confederate Soldier Monument.</p>

<p>Many sculptors who were born outside of Virginia have used events and personalities
of Virginia as their subjects. Charles Keck executed a bronze group
of statues of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, the two explorers of the
Northwest, which may be seen at Charlottesville. Lewis and Clark are shown
gazing at the horizon, with their famous woman guide, Sacajawea, not far behind
them. At Monument Terrace in Lynchburg is another bronze statue designed by
Keck, "Statue of a Doughboy," representing the forty-seven soldiers from Lynchburg
killed in World War I. Keck also created the statue of John Tyler located
in the Capitol Rotunda at Richmond.</p>

<p>There is a George Rogers Clark Memorial in Charlottesville designed by Robert
Aitken. It consists of a bronze equestrian statue of George Rogers Clark surrounded
by a group of Indians and scouts.</p>

<p>Six statues depicting the Virginia-born Presidents of the United States found
in the Capitol Rotunda are "William Henry Harrison" carved by Charles Beach,
"Woodrow Wilson" by Harriet Frishmuth, "James Monroe" and "Thomas Jefferson"
by Attilio Piccirilli and "James Madison" and "Zachary Taylor" by F. William
Sievers.</p>

<p>Piccirilli also created a 16-foot marble "Statue of Monroe" located at the entrance
of Ash Lawn, the home of James Monroe, near Charlottesville. An interesting
fact about this statue is that, after the government of Venezuela had commissioned
Piccirilli to create this statue of Monroe, a revolution occurred in Venezuela
which caused a new slate of officials to succeed in office. Since some of these
officials were not pro-Monroe in their regard for the Monroe Doctrine, the statue
remained in a studio in New York City from the latter part of the 1800's until
1931. Sievers also designed the bronze figure of "Stonewall" Jackson astride his
horse, Little Sorrel, for the "Stonewall" Jackson Monument on Monument Avenue
in Richmond.</p>

<p>Sculptural contributions of Thomas Crawford and Randolph Rogers, both
New Yorkers, may be found in Capitol Square, Richmond. The Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Monument here is considered an outstanding sculptural group. Robert Mills
designed the base and pedestal. The monument depicts a bronze equestrian statue
of George Washington on a stone base surrounded by huge figures of Patrick
Henry, Thomas Jefferson, General Andrew Lewis, John Marshall, George Mason
and Thomas Nelson. Female figures are seated on trophies of victory around the
base of the monument. All the figures were created by Crawford except Lewis
and Nelson which were created by Rogers after Crawford had died.</p>

<p>Virginians were encouraged to appreciate the Fine Arts even as early as 1786
when a Frenchman, Chevalier de Beaurepaire, founded in Richmond the Academy
of Sciences and Fine Arts of the United States of America. This organization
marked the formal beginning of Richmond as a cultural center in Virginia. In
1936, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond became the first state-supported
art museum in the United States. At present, the Museum Building,
its equipment and the salaries of the staff are provided by the Commonwealth;
other sources of revenue come from endowments, gifts, membership, rental and
admission fees. There are numerous traveling exhibitions, slide sets, films and
filmstrips, permanent famous art collections, temporary loan exhibits and an Art-mobile
equipped with a comprehensive art display which travels to specific areas
on a scheduled basis. There is also a Museum Theater where a variety of performances
in the Fine Arts including the dance, music, drama and motion pictures
is presented.</p>

<p>In 1913, the Battle Abbey was constructed in Richmond. It is noted for its
large wall murals painted by the French artist, Charles Hoffbauer and portraying
the key battles of the War between the States. Battle Abbey also includes valuable
collections of paintings of Confederate leaders, of battle flags and of military
weapons used during the War between the States.</p>

<p>The White House of the Confederacy in Richmond, known also as the Confederate
Museum, is the beautiful old Brockenbrough Mansion leased for the
home of Jefferson Davis and his family during the War between the States. In
1893, the Confederate Memorial Literary Society established the house as a
Confederate historical museum. Such historical treasures as the sword of Robert
E. Lee, military equipment of "J. E. B." Stuart, T. J. Jackson and Joseph E. Johnston
and individual sections housing battle mementoes of each Confederate State
are located in this structure.</p>

<p>The Valentine house in Richmond, bequeathed to the city by Mann S. Valentine
in 1892, was opened to the public as a museum in 1930. In addition to its
specialized exhibits on Richmond historical treasures, this museum has some of
the original casts of Edward V. Valentine (the sculptor), several rare books concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Virginia and exhibits on world history and civilizations. Another famous
museum which was constructed in 1930 is the Mariners' Museum at Newport
News. A personal comprehensive collection of over 45,000 nautical articles
(including ship models, figureheads and pictorial material) owned by Archer M.
Huntington is housed in this museum.</p>

<p>The skills and techniques of painting are currently taught in the schools, colleges
and art clubs, as well as by private tutors, throughout Virginia. Thus, the
Commonwealth offers excellent opportunities for the encouragement of, and
appreciation for, meaningful art and sculpture.</p>


<h3><em>Architecture</em></h3>

<p>Architecture is often defined as the science and art of designing and constructing
buildings or structures. Historically, architecture in Virginia is considered to
have begun in 1611-1615 with the building of the first frame row houses at
Jamestown and at Henrico. Previous to this period, only crude dwellings had
been constructed. The typical early row house, however, was a timber structure
usually two stories high with an upper garret often included. Some of the early
colonists were bricklayers, brickmakers and carpenters. Often, the Virginia
colonists built a typical English timber cottage as similar as possible to those in
their homeland insofar as the availability of materials in Virginia would allow.
A gabled shingled roof was commonly used; wherever they could be afforded,
dormer windows were added. Such a frame house usually measured one room
deep and two rooms wide or two rooms deep and a passage-way wide. In the
latter type, huge chimneys were usually constructed at each end.</p>

<p>One of the first types of Seventeenth Century brick houses is exemplified by
the "Adam Thoroughgood" House built between 1636 and 1640 in Princess Anne
County near Cape Henry. It has one complete story topped by a steep gabled roof
with dormers and with two T-shaped chimneys. Like many of the early houses
in Virginia, its interior is finished in pine paneling. Winona, in Northampton
County, is another illustration of the early architectural house in Virginia. It
consists of a story and a half structure with brick walls. One of the unique features
of the house has been hidden from public view by a frame addition: a buttressed
chimney surpassed by three extremely tall stacks.</p>

<p>The houses in Virginia whose construction is believed to have been directly
affected by the English Renaissance or Georgian Period of architecture were built
after 1720. Since the College of William and Mary had been established at
Williamsburg and the colonial capital had been changed from Jamestown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Williamsburg, this area had become the greatest cultural center as well as the
seat of government of Virginia. It is commonly believed that the important buildings
in Williamsburg in 1720&mdash;namely, the Wren Building at the College of
William and Mary, the Governor's Palace and the Capitol&mdash;actually set the pattern
for architectural designs for private homes and public buildings throughout
the colony.</p>

<p>The Wren Building is the only structure in America designed by the great
Sir Christopher Wren and is the oldest academic hall in the United States. The
original design of Wren had to be altered slightly because of the terrain of the
country-side. The building, consisting of the commonly used sandy pink brick
foundation material, is a two-and-one-half storied rectangular building with a steep
roof which includes twelve dormer windows. The roof is topped by a plain cupola
in the center with two huge chimneys on either side. Although the Wren Building
was burned and rebuilt on three different occasions, in 1928 some of the
original walls were used as the basis for the restoration and repair of the Wren
Building as part of the Williamsburg Restoration Project.</p>

<p>The Governor's Palace illustrates another Georgian architectural design in
Williamsburg. It consists of two stories rising to a cornice topped by a steep,
many-dormered roof. Atop the roof is a platform with a lantern-cupola. There
are narrow sash windows on the fa&#231;ade and a plain square-transomed doorway
with a center wrought-iron balcony overhead. There are separate buildings for
the smokehouse, dairy, kitchen and laundry. Above the doorway of the Governor's
Palace is the carved coat of arms of George II and Britain's Royal Lion and
Unicorn. The fine paneled woodwork in the interior of the palace and the antique
tooled leather walls of the library are also noteworthy.</p>

<p>The Capitol at Williamsburg, originally completed in 1704 and later reconstructed
on the original foundations, is a two-storied H-shaped brick structure
with semicircular bays on either end and a connecting gallery in the center over
an arched porch. The roof of the gallery is topped with a cupola which has the
arms of Queen Anne, a clock and the Union Jack, one above the other. The
Capitol was restored in 1920.</p>

<p>The George Wythe House in Williamsburg is considered one of the purest
Georgian Colonial architectural structures in America. George Wythe was the
first law professor at the College of William and Mary. The house was a gift from
his father-in-law. Although this structure was a town house, it had numerous
separate buildings&mdash;kitchen, smokehouse, laundry, stable&mdash;similar to a plantation.
The house is rectangular in shape, constructed of brick and has two built-in
chimneys. Under the restoration project, the original paint colors in many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the rooms have been matched, and it is now furnished with appropriate furniture
of that period.</p>

<p>Other houses built about this time reveal the similarity of designs of private
estates to the Governor's Palace. Westover (1733), home of Colonel William
Byrd II on the James River, is considered by many historians and architects as the
finest example of colonial grandeur and Georgian stateliness in Virginia. English
wrought-iron gates are fastened to posts at the top of which are two leaden eagles
with half-spread wings. The mansion house is constructed of red brick with a
center section two stories high. On either side of the center section is a wing a
story and a half high connected by passageways. At both ends of the house are
pairs of tall chimneys. Elaborate entrances, paneled walls, an open-string staircase
and black and white marble mantels imported from Italy are some of the elegant
features still found in the mansion at the present time.</p>

<p>Christ Church in Lancaster County was erected about the same time as Westover.
This structure is an example of a Greek-cruciform colonial church. The
church is constructed of brick, has three wide brick doors, oval windows and has
the unusual history of having been built solely with funds furnished by one
individual, the wealthy "King" Carter.</p>

<p>Stratford Hall (1725-1730) in Westmoreland County, the home of Thomas
Lee and the birthplace of Robert E. Lee, exemplifies another H-shaped house of
beauty and grandeur. Constructed of brick and dominated by two groups of four
chimneys, Stratford consists of the H-plan with four large attached buildings at
the corners. A unique feature of this house is its exceptionally long flight of
stairs which one must ascend before reaching the main floor. The main floor consists
of five large rooms with a huge hall which forms the bar of the "H." Each
wing also has a pair of rooms connected by passages.</p>

<p>Carter's Grove (1751) in James City County is another Georgian type house,
planned and partially constructed by Carter Burwell in 1751. The main unit of
the mansion was constructed by the English builder, Richard Bayliss, and another
Britisher, David Minitree. The mansion consists of two-and-a-half stories with
wings on each side of one story. It is particularly noteworthy for its almost perfect
symmetry. The main unit has a very high roof with a pair of large square chimneys.
There are several dormer windows and the entire structure is 200 feet long.
The interior as well as the exterior is beautiful with extensive pine paneling, a
graceful arch across the middle of the main hall and exquisitely carved walnut
railings along the stairway. Some officers of Lt. Col. Banaster Tarleton's troops
used this place as headquarters in 1781. When Tarleton suddenly needed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
troops, he rode horseback up the beautiful carved stairway. The horse's hoofprints
are still observable on the stairway steps.</p>

<p>Mount Airy in Richmond County was constructed by Colonel John Tayloe in
1758. This house is unusual because it was built entirely of stone, a rarity because
the Tidewater area did not have an extensive amount of stone. Mount Airy
is built of brown stone and trimmed with light stone furnishing a colorful
contrast.</p>

<p>The architecture of churches in Virginia is likewise varied. St. Luke's Church,
originally known as the Brick Church in Isle of Wight County, is believed to be
the oldest church still in existence in the original thirteen colonies. It is easily
recognizable from its square tower and gabled nave. The brick Jamestown Church
Tower (1639) is a Gothic structure also. The famous Bruton Parish Church in
Williamsburg (1715) is an example of the change in architecture due to Governor
Spottswood's planned improvement program for Williamsburg. This is the
oldest Episcopal Church continuously in use in Virginia. Its cruciform construction
of red brick is unusual with its numerous high, white shuttered windows.
The square tower was built at a later date and seems to add dignity to the structure.
Christ Church in Alexandria, constructed in 1767-1772, has characteristics
of the late Georgian Colonial Period: red brick, a square tower with an octagonal-shaped
belfry having a dome cupola, a trimming of white stone and a crown of
Wrennish pepperpots.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson contributed much to original Virginia architecture. Jefferson
was devoted to the classical style, yet followed new trends of his own. For
example, the Capitol at Richmond was planned by Jefferson. Jefferson used the
famous Roman temple at N&#238;mes in southern France, the Maison Carr&#233;e, as the
basic design and modified it according to his wishes. He had a plaster model of it
made in Paris and sent to Virginia to be used as the pattern for the new Capitol.
The original building is the central building which was constructed from 1785
to 1788. Later, the brick was covered with stucco and the wings and the long
flight of steps were added in 1904-1906. The revival of classicism in architecture
is traced to the individual efforts of Thomas Jefferson. His contacts with many
of the outstanding architects of the time, including Robert Mills, helped spread
the classic ideas throughout the nation. Thus, the dignity of the great plantation
houses constructed during this period is attributed to the style advocated by
Jefferson. He not only favored this style but proceeded to utilize the style which
he advocated. Monticello, Jefferson's home at Charlottesville, was built of red
brick. Its dome, its Doric columns, its symmetrical arrangement, its circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
windows, its octagonal bay and stately porticos, its wedgewood mantelpiece&mdash;all
characterize the Early Republican type of architecture in Virginia.</p>

<p>Jefferson carried out a similar classical style when he founded the University
of Virginia. The Serpentine Walls of red brick which surround most of the gardens
were designed and built by Jefferson, following a type he had seen in
France. The walls are approximately six feet high and one brick thick and constructed
on a wavelike plan for added strength. Jefferson also designed the five
two-story temple-like pavilions including porticos and had them constructed of
red brick walls with white trim and white classic columns. Bremo, near Fork
Union, and Poplar Forest, near Lynchburg (where Jefferson used to spend quiet
weekends in retreat) are two other houses designed and built by Jefferson.</p>

<p>Robert Mills, who received architectural instruction from Jefferson and whose
name is associated with the colonnade of the Treasury Building in Washington
and with the Washington Monuments in Washington and in Baltimore, also
contributed to the development of architecture in Virginia. Mills designed the
Monumental Episcopal Church in Richmond with its structure of stuccoed brick
and brown sandstone, its octagonal domes and its columns. Mills' stuccoed houses
in Richmond are considered most unique. The front of this type of house which
faced the street is comparatively plain and simple, but the back of the house which
faced the river usually had a graceful, tall, columned portico with a hanging balcony.
Thus, Mills' houses had the appearance of a regular city house in the front
and a country house in the back. The Valentine Museum, formerly the John
Wickham House, and the White House of the Confederacy, formerly the Jefferson
Davis Mansion, located in Richmond were both designed by Robert Mills.</p>

<p>Sherwood Forest, located on the James River, was the home of John Tyler,
tenth President of the United States, after he retired from the Presidency. He
enlarged the originally-built dwelling twofold and also had a closed-in colonnade
constructed to connect the main house with the kitchen and the laundry. After
a ballroom and an office had also been added, the entire structure was 300 feet
long, one of the longest houses in the country. The original house was built in
1780 with additions made in 1845.</p>

<p>When Jefferson with his great fervor for originality died, Virginia architecture
seemed to lose its original character. For many years afterwards, Virginia tended
to follow the architecture fashion of the nation rather than to create any particular
architectural characteristics of its own. Following the War between the States
and its resulting poverty, many of the skills of the earlier craftsmen seemed to
disappear. There was a lack of artistic brickwork and handcarved woodwork;
imitation and copying of designs throughout the nation seemed to dominate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
architectural scene. The influence of much of the foreign architecture of this
period seemed to crowd the American scene and to stifle American originality.
Experimentation, not often beautiful in appearance or graceful in lines, resulted
in an era of architecture with mediocre dwellings and a lack of symmetry and of
balanced proportions in design.</p>

<p>Near the close of the Nineteenth Century, an event occurred which influenced
American architecture to a great extent. When the Chicago World's Fair was
held in 1893, visitors suddenly became reminiscent about the numerous reconstructed
American architectural designs of colonial buildings: the rich-looking
red brick buildings with graceful, tall white columns and with porticos and pediments.
Architects in the United States as well as the American public in general
found a new interest in the construction designs, techniques and materials of the
Colonial Era. Several visits were made to Virginia and other southern states in
an attempt to rediscover the true Colonial style which still has so much to offer
in the way of beauty, simplicity and grandeur.</p>

<p>As in the other states, Virginia architects have been busy recently drawing up
plans to meet the ever-increasing demand for private dwellings as well as for
public buildings. Some of the structures in Virginia which have received nationwide
attention are the five-sided, five-floored Pentagon Building in Arlington with
17&frac12; miles of corridors, the Iwo Jima Memorials&mdash;one at Quantico and one in
Arlington County&mdash;and numerous houses, apartment buildings, schools, churches
and business establishments.</p>

<p>The greatest architectural restoration project in the United States is the Restoration
of Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Intense, careful research has made
this restoration authentic and appealing to the American public. John D. Rockefeller,
Jr. made the project possible through financial backing and, to date, over
400 colonial public buildings, homes, shops and taverns have been restored or
reconstructed on a 216 acre section of land. Many of the restored buildings&mdash;the
Capitol, the Governor's Palace, the George Wythe House, the Raleigh Tavern,
the Public Gaol, the Ludwell-Paradise House, the Brush-Everard House and the
Magazine and Guardhouse&mdash;are now furnished properly according to the Eighteenth
Century style. Additional atmosphere is created by the colorful, colonial
costumes worn by the guides themselves. The restoration continues, and visitors
from various parts of the world, as well as from all of the fifty states, delight
in viewing authentic colonial architecture. The Williamsburg Project has had,
and will continue to have, a definite influence upon American architecture.</p>

<p>In retrospect, Virginia is usually accredited professionally with two distinct
types of individual architecture: the Colonial type brought directly from England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and adapted to American surroundings (with a slight variation in Early Colonial
and Late Colonial due to the results of the European Renaissance) and the
Jeffersonian type distinguished by the creativeness and superb artistic traits of
Thomas Jefferson.</p>


<h3><em>Music and Drama</em></h3>

<p>Music&mdash;The early Jamestown settlers left no record of their music. They
apparently sang the same songs current in England at the time of their departure
and probably made up verses pertaining to their environment as time passed.
There is evidence that unusual instruments were occasionally used. Even though
organs were very expensive in colonial days, by 1700 the Episcopal Church at
Port Royal owned the first pipe organ brought to America from Europe. By 1755,
the Bruton Parish Church at Williamsburg had also received one.</p>

<p>The wealthy inhabitants usually paid instrumentalists, often foreign musicians,
to play at various social functions. String players were particularly popular, not
only for chamber music concerts but also for private balls. In 1788, Francis
Hopkinson, considered by many historians as the first American composer, dedicated
his most ambitious published work, "Seven Songs," for the harpsichord or
forte piano to George Washington, his personal friend. Although Washington
himself did not play an instrument he was an active patron of the arts including
music. The harpsichord which he bought for Nellie Custis is still at Mount
Vernon. Hopkinson also had written in 1778 a musical manuscript called "Toast"
commemorating Washington's position as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental
Army. After Hopkinson had made improvements on the harpsichord, he contacted
Thomas Jefferson, beseeching him to acquaint craftsmen with his new,
musical instrumental idea. Jefferson was a great devotee to music and was considered
by many as an accomplished violin player as was Patrick Henry before him.</p>

<p>The musical talents of the Negroes are usually associated with Southern music.
From time to time, collections of slave songs, plantation and cabin songs and
religious spirituals have been published by William F. Allen, Lucy M. Garrison,
Charles P. Ware, Natalie Burlin and Thomas Fenner. The Hampton Singers
from Hampton Institute still preserve the musical beauty of such Negro Spirituals
as "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," "Go Down Moses," "Deep River," "Steal Away
to Jesus" and "O'er the Crossing." Reverend James P. Carrell of Harrisonburg
and Lebanon published two spiritual song books: "Songs of Zion" and "Virginia
Harmony." James A. Bland, a Negro originally from South Carolina but educated
in Washington, wrote the song: "Carry Me Back to Ole Virginny." This
song was adopted by the legislature as the official state song in 1940. Two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
famous songs written by Bland were "Dem Golden Slippers" and "In the Evening
by the Moonlight."</p>

<p>Musical publishers and choral groups also encouraged active participation in
the musical field. Joseph Funk, a German immigrant, came to Singer's Glen near
Harrisonburg near the beginning of the Nineteenth Century. He established a
singing school where he taught vocal music and published "Choral Music," a
collection of German songs. Aldine Kieffer, a grandson of Funk, created a
monthly musical publication, "Musical Millions," consisting of rural music and
musical hints for singing schools. Kieffer wrote the words and B. C. Unseld the
music to a song which became very popular in the rural areas of the South:
"Twilight Is Falling." In 1883, Theodore Presser of Lynchburg founded the
well-known music publication for music teachers and pianists called "The Etude."
Scholars and music lovers in various parts of the world have enjoyed the contents
of this publication. F. Flaxington Harker was a Scotsman who came to America
and served as an outstanding choral director in Richmond. He composed organ
compositions, choruses, sacred and secular songs, anthems and cantatas. A collection
of Virginia Folklore Songs, called "The Traditional Ballads of Virginia,"
has been compiled by Arthur Kyle Davis, Jr. and C. Alphonso Smith.</p>

<p>Jenny Lind, "The Swedish Nightingale," afforded Richmonders a thrill when
she appeared in person at the Marshall Theater in 1850. She was considered an
outstanding singer by Virginia music lovers. In 1876, Thomas Paine Westendorf
of Bowling Green wrote the song, "I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen," presumably
for his wife while she was mourning the death of her son: she had traveled
away from home with her husband and had become very homesick, prompting
him to write the song as words of encouragement to her.</p>

<p>The composer who is professionally considered as the greatest native Virginian
contributor to the music field is John Powell of Richmond and Charlottesville.
He was an accomplished pianist and studied in Vienna as well as in the United
States. He wrote "Sonata Virginianesque" for violin and piano (a sonata consisting
of the happy aspects of plantation life before the War between the States),
several overtures and folk-songs. He became nationally famous for his "Rhapsodie
Negre" for piano and orchestra. His varied talents included the writing of
fugues and concertos as well as the creation of the Virginia State Choral Festival.
Powell was also an enthusiastic participant in the annual White Top Folk Music
Festival. No description of musical contributions of Virginians would be complete
without reference to Joe Sweeney, a native of Appomattox who invented
the five-stringed banjo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard Bales, a native of Alexandria, is a composer-conductor who arranged
a cantata, "The Confederacy," consisting of music and literary compositions of
the Confederate States during the War between the States. This cantata was so
well received that it inspired him to compose a second one called "The Union"
which consists of music and literary comments concerning the Union forces during
the War between the States. He also composed "The Republic" which consists
of prominent European and American musical trends of the Eighteenth Century.</p>

<p>Regional festivals and a State Festival for public school bands and choral
groups are held each year. Symphony orchestras furnish superb musical entertainment
regularly in Richmond, Norfolk and Roanoke. Numerous Virginians
have been, and are, active in the music field as singers of classical, semi-classical
and popular tunes of the day. Thus, contributions to vocal music, instrumental
music and musical forms have been made by natives and residents of Virginia.</p>

<p>Drama&mdash;Unlike residents of many of the thirteen original colonies, Virginia
residents delighted in the drama. An Accomack County record states that a group
of non-professionals performed in a play, "Ye Beare and Ye Cub," as early as
1655. This record is believed to be the earliest available evidence of an English-speaking
play presented in the American colonies.</p>

<p>Virginia is also proud of the fact that the very first theater called a playhouse
was constructed by William Levingston at Williamsburg in 1716. Its purpose
was to present "Comedies, Drolls, and other kind of stage plays ... as shall be
thought fitt to be acted there." In spite of its lofty origin, it soon became a financial
loss and, in 1745, the original structure was allotted to Williamsburg to be
used as a town hall.</p>

<p>Six years later, however, a second theater was constructed behind the Capitol
at Williamsburg. The opening play was "Richard III" and its performers subsequently
enacted this play also at Petersburg and at Fredericksburg. It was at the
Williamsburg Playhouse that the famous Hallams (London Company, later
known as the American Company) first performed in America. The Hallam
family&mdash;father, mother and two children&mdash;and their supporting cast landed
at Yorktown where they were welcomed by Governor Dinwiddie and a group of
his personal friends. They later traveled to Williamsburg where the playhouse
had received appropriate improvements and alterations in keeping with the occasion.
Their performance was a success as evidenced by the fact that their play,
"The Merchant of Venice," played for eleven months in Williamsburg.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Virginia Museum of Fine Arts</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Other plays including tragedies and comedies, famous and not so famous, were
acted at the Williamsburg Playhouse. Most of the plays during this period were
European plays or American imitation of European plays. The playhouses themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
were usually wooden structures with crude benches for the average customers
and a few "less uncomfortable" boxes for the aristocrats. In the winter,
the heat was usually furnished by one stove in the center of the end of the barn-like
structure where the spectators congregated between the acts. Often, spectators
carried their individual footwarmers with them to assure themselves of
comfort during the play. Candles at first were the sole means of illumination.
A custom which was practiced for many years consisted of the Negro servants
arriving at the playhouse hours before the six o'clock curtain time and reserving
seats for their masters by sitting in the most desirable areas until the arrival of
the masters.</p>

<p>The early drama companies were often organized and managed as a regular
stock company with the importance of the dramatic role determining the number
of shares received by an actor. Another common method of paying outstanding
actors was the holding of a "benefit" night near the end of the season whereby
the receipts of that night would be given to the individual actor.</p>

<p>The playhouse provided one of the most popular types of amusement and it
soon became a colorful place for gay, social gatherings. Since Williamsburg was
the capital of the colony of Virginia, during legislative sessions the playhouse was
particularly crowded with important personages of the government and their
friends. George Washington enjoyed dramatic presentations very much and on
numerous occasions visited the Williamsburg Playhouse. Just before the American
Revolution, however, as political, economic and social relationships between
the Americans and the British were being severely strained, most forms of entertainment
including the playhouse were prohibited. Consequently, the Virginia
playhouses eventually closed and most of the actors and actresses traveled to
foreign shores.</p>

<p>After Governor Thomas Jefferson and numerous other Virginians believed that
Williamsburg was no longer a safe or central location, the capital of Virginia was
moved to the Town of Richmond in 1779. Seven years later, a new theater in
Richmond was opened on Shockoe Hill. For twenty-five years, this theater was
a social gathering place and a stage background for numerous plays during this
period. On December 26, 1811, tragedy struck this theater when it was crowded
with holiday festive guests at a benefit performance for the actor, Placide, and
his daughter. The entertainment in the theater usually consisted of a prologue,
a feature play, a short afterpiece and, sometimes, singing or dancing. On this
fateful date, the feature had been completed and the afterpiece was being enacted.
Suddenly, a lamp which was used for creating overhead light was mistakenly
jerked by a pulley, causing it to swing fully lit into the oil-painted scenery back-drop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Soon the entire theater was a flaming mass. Seventy-three persons were
killed in this tragedy including Governor George William Smith. This incident
caused many theater-goers to refrain from attending theater performances for
several years because of fear for their personal safety.</p>

<p>Drama in Virginia, consequently, received a serious setback from this tragedy,
but in 1818, a new theater was built through subscription at Seventh and Broad
Streets in Richmond. It was called the Marshall Theater and was named in honor
of Chief Justice John Marshall who was one of the theater's greatest patrons.
Although this new structure was larger, more conveniently situated and more
safely constructed, fear still kept the large crowds of the earlier theater from
attending. The theater for a time had to depend upon a famous performer to
assure patronage by large numbers. In July 1821, one of these celebrated performers
was Junius Brutus Booth&mdash;father of the American actor, Edwin Booth&mdash;who
made his American debut at the Marshall Theater in "Richard III."</p>

<p>By the middle of the Nineteenth Century, Virginia began to experience the
"Golden Age" of its theater. Richmond still was the center of the drama in
Virginia and one of the outstanding dramatic centers in the United States. The
opinion and reaction of Richmond audiences and critics became respected and
noticed throughout the country. Such well-known actors as Edwin Forrest,
William C. Macready and James W. Wallack played here. On January 2, 1862,
the Marshall Theater burned, but its owner immediately had a new one called
the Richmond Playhouse built on the same site. Its opening premiere was "As
You Like It" starring Ida Vernon and D'Orsay Ogden. Even though the War
between the States was being fought, contrary to the Revolutionary War period,
the theater furnished amusement and relaxation. Jefferson Davis, President of
the Confederacy, and many of his cabinet members attended this theater and
viewed many of its tragedies which strangely enough seemed to be the type of play
preferred over comedies at this time. One of the favorite actresses of the soldier
audiences was Sally Partington.</p>

<p>As the years passed, additional theaters were built in Virginia including the
Theater of Varieties in Richmond where vaudeville was first introduced. By the
end of the Nineteenth Century, two native Virginians had become dramatic character
actors of national fame: Wilton Lackaye of Loudoun County and George
Fawcett of Fairfax County. At the turn of the century, Bill Robinson, a native
of Richmond, began his ascent to national and international fame for his superb
dance style and routines, not only in vaudeville but also in New York plays and,
later, in moving pictures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the Twentieth Century, Francis Xavier Bushman of Norfolk was one
of the early moving picture lead actors. As the movies improved and increased in
their scope, Virginians such as Jack Hall of Winchester, James H. Bell of Suffolk,
Margaret Sullavan of Norfolk, Randolph Scott of Orange County, Richard Arlen
of Charlottesville, Lynn Bari of Roanoke, Joseph Cotten of Petersburg, Henry
King of Christiansburg, John Payne of Roanoke, Charles Gilpin of Richmond
and Freeman F. Gosden of Richmond became nationally known for their acting.</p>

<p>Although strong competition of vaudeville, moving pictures, radio and television
undoubtedly has affected the legitimate theater, the strong desire for legitimate
acting still remains and has resulted in the formation of summer stock
companies and numerous Little Theater groups throughout Virginia. Such groups
have become very active and are found in many cities including Alexandria,
Danville, Lynchburg, Norfolk, Petersburg, Richmond and Staunton. Virginia
colleges and universities also keep the theater alive by sponsoring dramatics
classes, workshops and plays.</p>

<p>Two recent developments of the theater in Virginia are the formation of the
Barter Theater Group and the presentation of historical plays. The Barter Theater
is part of the Barter Colony located at Abingdon, and this colony consists of the
theater, a workshop, an inn and a dormitory. The colony was established by
Robert and Helen F. Porterfield in 1932 as an attempt to create renewed interest
in legitimate play-acting. An original, unique feature of the theater and the
activity which was directly responsible for its name was the original ticket purchase
price which could be obtained in exchange for produce or edible commodities&mdash;similar
to the old-fashioned barter system of exchange; at present,
however, theater patrons pay money rather than produce for their tickets. During
the winter months, the cast travels in other nearby states as well as in Virginia.
An annual Barter Theater award was established by Robert Porterfield in 1939
for the "finest performance by an actor or actress on the current Broadway stage."
Such well-known individuals as Laurette Taylor, Dorothy Stickney, Mildred
Natwick, Ethel Barrymore, Tallulah Bankhead, Louis Calhern, Helen Hayes,
Henry Fonda, Frederic March, Shirley Booth, Cornelia Otis Skinner, David
Wayne, Rosalind Russell, Mary Martin, Ethel Merman and Ralph Bellamy have
received this award. The Barter Theater Award consists of an acre of land located
near Abingdon, a world-famed Virginia ham and a silver octagonal platter "to
eat it off." In addition, the recipient is given the opportunity to nominate two
young dramatic actors at New York City auditions for acting positions at the
Barter Theater. The Barter Theater, now recognized as the State Theater of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Virginia, is believed to be the only professional theater in the United States
which receives financial aid from a state budget.</p>

<p>Since 1947, an outstanding play, "The Common Glory," written by Pulitzer
Prize Winner Paul Green, has been presented in the summer at the Lake Matoaka
Amphitheater in Williamsburg. The theme of "The Common Glory" is
based upon important historical events from 1774 through 1783 with the famous
comments of such American statesmen as Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin,
Robert Livingston and Patrick Henry. The realistic performance of this theme in
the historical outdoor, natural setting in Williamsburg near historical Jamestown
and Yorktown is an experience the audience long remembers. Paul Green also
wrote "The Founders," another historical drama in honor of the three hundred
and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Jamestown.</p>

<p>Music and drama&mdash;from both the creative sense and the participation sense&mdash;still
remain an active phase of culture in Virginia.</p>


<h3><em>Education</em></h3>

<p>In colonial days in Virginia, education was considered a personal family matter.
A public school, as the term is understood now, was non-existent. Since England
had no national public system of education until 1833, the Virginia colonists, of
whom a majority were of English descent, did not have any heritage for schools
for the general public. Later, the geographical distances between the plantations
and the gradual development of social classes tended to discourage public education.
The typical child who received formal education was taught by the family
members, privately tutored, apprenticed for farming, attended a "Pay School" or
"Old Field School" (a community school taught by a teacher paid either by the
individual parents or by a particular patron and located on relatively poor agricultural
land), enrolled in a Latin Grammar School or attended a fashionable
school in London. Only the boys received the formal education and the girls
learned the proper techniques of performing household tasks and of being a
gracious hostess. Many poor children had no formal education of any kind.</p>

<p>In 1634, the Syms Free School in Elizabeth City County was organized as a
local, free school as a direct result of provisions of a will whereby two hundred
acres of land were provided and free milk and income from eight cows were
included for the support of the school. Twenty-five years later, Dr. Thomas Eaton
of the same county also endowed a free school and left a five hundred acre estate
with buildings and livestock as the endowment. The endowment also provided
for the maintenance of an "able schoolmaster to educate and teach the children
born within the County of Elizabeth." Later, the two schools were combined and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
by the beginning of the Twentieth Century, they had been incorporated into the
public school system as the Syms-Eaton Academy.</p>

<p>A few church schools were organized, but they reached a very small number
of children with their enrollment. Orphans and poor children often received the
benefits of apprenticeship training in trade or industrial schools and eventually
had an opportunity to learn to read and write. By 1775, there were nine free
schools endowed by private philanthropists for the poor and needy. Public schools
at this time in Virginia were considered as schools for paupers, orphans and needy
financial cases rather than schools for the benefit of the general public. Community
tax-supported schools for the children of the general public were practically
unknown.</p>

<p>Until the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, the slaves&mdash;both Negro and
Indian&mdash;were usually taught religious training and some primary learning, the
amount and type of training depending upon the individual master. After certain
sensational articles tended to cause discontent and confusion in the minds of some
of these individuals which resulted in sporadic raids and open dissatisfaction
with living conditions, the legislature of Virginia passed a law making it illegal
to teach any slave how to read, write or do arithmetic.</p>

<p>By the middle of the Nineteenth Century, private academies and seminaries
(for girls) began to replace the early Latin-Grammar schools. The subjects of
English, Latin, science, mathematics, public speaking, spelling and penmanship
were taught. The fine arts subjects such as painting and music were stressed in
the seminaries. Some of the early academies included Prince Edward Academy
(later became Hampden-Sydney Academy and, eventually, Hampden-Sydney
College), Liberty Hall Academy (later, Washington College and, eventually,
Washington and Lee University), Fredericksburg Academy (later, Fredericksburg
College), Alexandria Academy, Shepherdstown Academy (later, Shepherdstown
College and, eventually, State Normal School in West Virginia), Central
Academy (later, Central College and, eventually, the University of Virginia),
Richmond Seminary (later, Richmond College), Salem Academy (later, Roanoke
College), Monongahela Academy (later, West Virginia University) and Marshall
Academy (later, Marshall College and, eventually, a State Normal School
in Huntington, West Virginia). These academies are considered forerunners of
public high schools in Virginia because, even as late as the period immediately
prior to the War between the States, there were very few public schools of any
type in Virginia.</p>

<p>Henrico University was the first attempt in Virginia at an institution for higher
learning. The Indian Massacre of 1622 ruined these conscientious efforts. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
first two colleges actually founded in Virginia were William and Mary College
at Williamsburg founded in 1693&mdash;the second oldest college in the thirteen
original colonies&mdash;and Washington and Lee University at Lexington founded in
1749. William and Mary College was founded for the purpose of providing an
opportunity for higher education within the colony itself; Washington and Lee
University&mdash;originally known as Augusta Academy, then Liberty Hall, and,
eventually, Washington College before being renamed Washington and Lee
University&mdash;was founded to educate young men in Virginia in a similar fashion
to the academies in England at that time. In 1819, the General Assembly passed
a law allotting $15,000 annually from the Literary Fund to be used for a state
university, the University of Virginia, to be located in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>As in most states, the early private colleges were usually founded by religious
groups. By the end of the Nineteenth Century, colleges had been established in
Virginia by Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Catholics, Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans
and the Brethren Sect. The following institutions were in existence at this
time: the Protestant Episcopal Theological Seminary in Alexandria, the University
of Richmond (Baptist), Hampden-Sydney College at Hampden-Sydney
(Presbyterian), St. Vincent's Seminary and College at Richmond (Catholic),
Emory and Henry College at Emory (Methodist), Roanoke College at Salem
(Lutheran), St. John's Catholic Academy and Seminary at Norfolk, Mary Baldwin
College at Staunton (for women&mdash;Presbyterian), Randolph-Macon College
at Ashland (for men&mdash;Methodist), Bridgewater College at Bridgewater (Brethren),
St. Paul's Polytechnic Institute at Lawrenceville (Episcopalian), the Virginia
Theological Seminary and College at Lynchburg (for Negroes), Randolph-Macon
College at Lynchburg (for women&mdash;Methodist), Union Theological
Seminary in Virginia at Richmond (Interdenominational) and Virginia Union
University at Richmond (for Negroes&mdash;Baptist).</p>

<p>Other colleges founded in the Nineteenth Century include the Hampton Institute
at Hampton (private&mdash;Negro), Medical College of Virginia at Richmond
(state), Hollins College at Hollins (private), Longwood College at Farmville
(state&mdash;women), Virginia Military Institute at Lexington (state), Virginia Polytechnic
Institute at Blacksburg (private) and Virginia State College at Petersburg
(Negro). Madison College was founded in 1908 at Harrisonburg as a private
institution of higher learning and, nine years later, Eastern Mennonite
College was also chartered in Harrisonburg.</p>

<p>The increase of women in colleges became apparent by the Twentieth Century
with the organization of Sweet Briar College at Sweet Briar (private), Mary
Washington College at Fredericksburg (women's division of the University of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Virginia&mdash;state), Randolph-Macon Woman's College at Lynchburg, Lynchburg
College at Lynchburg (coed&mdash;Disciples of Christ) and Radford College at Radford
(women's division of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute&mdash;state). In addition,
there are seven junior colleges: Stratford at Danville, Averett at Danville, Southern
Seminary and Junior College at Buena Vista, Sullins at Bristol, Marion at
Marion, Virginia Intermont at Bristol&mdash;all colleges for women only. These additional
junior colleges&mdash;Shenandoah at Dayton, Bluefield at Bluefield and Ferrum
at Ferrum&mdash;are coed institutions.</p>

<p>Public schools were initially supported by a Literary Fund and by one-half the
capitation tax. Gradually, all the capitation or poll tax money was transferred to
the Literary Fund. After the middle of the Nineteenth Century, some cities and
counties in Virginia began to adopt a system of free schools for the general public.
For the first time, a favorable attitude toward public education on the part of a
majority of the Virginians became apparent. The long-assumed idea that public
schools were charity schools tinged with a social stigma faded into the background
and public education for all the children began to be widely encouraged. Before
much actual progress along this line was achieved, however, the War between the
States took place. As a result, most of the academies were forced to close and
education for a time became a comparatively minor issue.</p>

<p>After the War between the States, the Underwood Constitution included a
provision requiring public education through the establishment of a uniform
system of free public schools in all counties of the state. The deadline date for
organizing and establishing such a system was 1876. A State Superintendent of
Public Instruction was elected by the General Assembly, a State Board of Education
was formed, and public education itself was financed by interest on the
Literary Fund, capitation tax revenue, revenue from state and local property taxes
and a state tax on each male twenty-one years old or over. Reverend William H.
Ruffner of Lexington was the first State Superintendent of Public Instruction in
Virginia.</p>

<p>Racial segregation in the public schools of Virginia was constitutionally established
in the Underwood Constitution of 1902. Section 149 stated that white
and colored children were not to be taught in the same schools. This idea had
been in existence in statute law since 1869-1870, and the Constitution of 1902
also specifically stated that public funds were to be restricted, with a few exceptions,
to public school use.</p>

<p>Gradually, teacher training courses were offered and improved and teacher
scholarships were created in the attempt to organize a large number of new
schools with qualified teacher personnel. Eventually, specialized courses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
offered in the elementary and secondary schools: vocational courses including
agricultural and industrial arts courses and household arts courses, Bible Study,
Music, Drawing, Art and commercial subjects such as bookkeeping, shorthand
and typing were introduced. These courses coupled with the original fundamental
courses provided a rich curriculum for the public school children of Virginia. By
1920, health examinations, health instructions and physical training were required
of each student. Early State Superintendents of Instruction faced tremendous
problems in their attempts to organize and develop a whole new school system.</p>

<p>The importance of education in Virginia by 1918 is ascertained by the fact that
the state legislature at that time passed an act ordering the State Board of Education
to appropriate a fund of not more than $10,000 to be used for a scientific
evaluation study of the Virginia schools by a special Survey Commission. Both
the Inglis Survey of 1919 (named after Dr. Alexander Inglis, Director of the
survey) and the O'Shea Survey of 1927 (named after Dr. M. V. O'Shea, Director
of the survey) resulted in considerable improvements in the organization and
administration of the educational system and in curricular offerings. Some of the
recommendations included the appointment of the State Board of Education by
the Governor with confirmation by the State Senate, the appointment of the
State Superintendent of Public Instruction by the State Board of Education, the
selection of a variety of basic textbooks by the State Board of Education, an increase
in vocational education courses of study, a minimum nine month academic
year, compulsory school attendance, improvement in teacher certification standards,
the county unit plan (rather than the district plan) of school organization
and a substantial increase in the salaries of teachers.</p>

<p>When the depression occurred in the late 1920's and early 1930's, Virginia
was affected but to a lesser degree than most of the other states. One of the first
items drastically reduced in the local and state budgets was school expenditures.
Regardless of its financial hardship, however, the educational system continued
to improve. A new Division of Instruction headed by a Director of Instruction
was created in the State Department of Education to assume the responsibility
of improving the instruction program in the Virginia public schools. Later, a
Supervisor of Elementary Education and a Supervisor of Music was added to the
State structure and a Supervisor of Secondary Education, a Supervisor of Negro
Education and a Supervisor of Physical and Health Education were selected.
Course content has been revised and new subjects added as needs warranted.
Recent progress includes the development of audio-visual aids, rehabilitation
education courses for disabled veterans, special education for the "exceptional"
child and for the mentally retarded child, distributive education and adult education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
courses. Most of the public schools in the Commonwealth now have a
twelve-year basic plan with the seven-five system predominating: seven years in
grade school (elementary) and five years in high school (secondary).</p>

<p>Some of the outstanding public educators in Virginia have been James Blair,
Reverend William H. Ruffner, R. R. Farr, Dr. F. V. N. Painter, John L. Buchanan,
John E. Massey, Joseph W. Southall, Joseph D. Eggleston, Dr. R. C.
Stearnes, Harris Hart, Sidney B. Hall, Dabney S. Lancaster, G. Tyler Miller,
Dowell J. Howard, Dr. Davis Y. Paschall, Dr. Woodrow W. Wilkerson&mdash;State
Superintendents of Public Instruction&mdash;George Wythe, Edwin Alderman, Edward
Armstrong, Samuel C. Armstrong, George Denny, Thomas R. Dew, William
H. McGuffey, Benjamin S. Ewell, John Langston, John T. Lomax, Booker
T. Washington, William Morton, William Pendleton, Thomas R. Price, Francis
Henry Smith, William Waugh Smith, Charles E. Vauter, William Wilson,
Milton Humphreys, Ed Joynes, Lyon Tyler and J. L. Blair Buck. Countless
individual teachers, state and local administrators, and parent-teacher organizations
have also contributed ideas which have influenced and improved the educational
facilities throughout the state.</p>

<p>Education has become one of the greatest problems in the Commonwealth and
a field of paramount interest to the citizens as well as to state and local officials,
the students, the parents, and the professional educational staff directly involved.
As the enrollments have rapidly increased, the governors, state legislators and local
officials have increased their concern and support, causing the educational facilities
to improve and expand. Such actions provide opportunities for the residents of
Virginia to obtain a well-rounded education.</p>


<h3><em class="gesperrt">SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>Literature reveals the everyday experiences of people as well as their dreams
and aspirations. Personal diaries, journals and letters were frequently used during
colonial days to describe ideas and events. Poetry was scarce but many scholarly
articles, often historically inclined, were written. Political thinking soon became
a favorite topic for written expression and biographies and essays became numerous.
Edgar Allan Poe, a resident of Virginia from his adoption at the age of
three, is considered the most original author for his creation of the modern
short story and the detective story. Virginians also have contributed several historical
and romantic novels. The distinguished history and picturesque setting
of Virginia has furnished innumerable topics of interest for written or oral
expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Art has flourished in Virginia from the handicraft of the early days to the
plastic sculpturing of the present. In the colonial period, European artists often
visited Virginia and used Virginia and her residents as their subjects. Later, Virginia
artists began to study abroad and, upon their return home, engaged primarily
in portrait and panorama painting. Edward Valentine created unusual, as well
as fine, sculptures. Foreign artists as well as native artists have often used Virginia
personalities and scenes as sources for their inspiration.</p>

<p>Although Virginia can claim only two separate types of original architecture&mdash;the
Colonial type influenced by England and altered to fit the environment of
Virginia and the Jeffersonian type originated through the artistic efforts of Thomas
Jefferson himself&mdash;Americans and foreigners still visit and study these architectural
types in an effort to imitate or perpetuate such desirable styles. The Commonwealth
has a variety of standard forms of architecture.</p>

<p>Organs, harpsichords and violins were popular musical instruments in colonial
days in Virginia. Gradually, American folk music, Negro spirituals, the founding
of the "Etude" music magazine and the invention of the five-stringed banjo tended
to increase and popularize music in Virginia. John Powell of Richmond is considered
Virginia's greatest single contributor to the musical composition field.</p>

<p>From the Williamsburg Theater of 1716 to the Barter Theater of the present,
Virginians have shared the spotlight, the hardships and the fame of plays, vaudeville,
moving pictures, radio and television. The annual production of "The
Common Glory," an historical drama, at Lake Matoaka Theater in Williamsburg
attracts thousands of patrons.</p>

<p>Education, the "backbone" of cultural activities, is one of the most challenging
current problems facing Virginia. Personal training in the home, apprenticeship
training outside the home, the church and church school education, private tutoring
and private and public institutions of education of the elementary, secondary
and higher education level&mdash;all are significant milestones along the educational
paths of Virginia. With the educational facilities expanding on all levels to meet
the rapidly increasing enrollment, with teacher training becoming more specialized,
with the improvement in standard courses and the addition of new courses of
study and with larger legislative appropriations for education, education in Virginia
provides more students with better opportunities for effective learning.</p>

<p>The changing pattern of everyday living can be recognized by observation and
analysis of the literature, art, architecture, music, drama and education of a
people. The inhabitants of the Commonwealth, consequently, have woven a
particular pattern of their own from their contributions to these various phases of
Cultural Life.</p>

Political Life</h2>


<h3><em>Background of Present State Constitution</em></h3>

<p>The original Constitution for the State of Virginia was written at a special
convention held in Williamsburg from May 7, 1776 to July 5, 1776. The
Constitution itself was officially adopted on June 29, 1776, making this date the
birth date of the State. The individual who was primarily responsible for most of
the content in the original Constitution was George Mason. The creation of the
first Constitution was unusual in two respects: at the time it was written, the
convention members decided upon specific powers which the newly-formed
government should not have before it determined those powers which it should
have; furthermore, the Constitution was adopted officially by the convention
members without the usual procedure of submitting it to the voters for final
ratification.</p>

<p>As years pass and conditions vary, it becomes necessary to make changes in the
framework of a government to meet such needs. Consequently, on four specific
occasions, the Constitution of Virginia has been rewritten: namely, in 1829-1830,
1850, 1867 and 1901.</p>

<p>In 1816, the residents west of the Blue Ridge Mountains demanded more
representation in their state government and fewer suffrage restrictions. After
many years of discontent, these individuals finally encouraged enough residents
throughout the state to vote for a constitutional convention to be held in Richmond
in 1829. At the convention, suffrage was extended slightly although all
non-real estate owners still could not vote. The term of the Governor was extended
to a three-year term with an increase in his powers, and representation was
reapportioned to benefit the inhabitants living west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
However, in the redistribution of seats in the House of Delegates, the residents in
the Trans-Allegheny section lost some seats. When the proposed Constitution was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
submitted to the people of Virginia for ratification, 26,055 voted for it and 15,166
voted against it. In this vote, for the first time, the Valley people of the western
part of the state joined the residents of the east rather than their Trans-Allegheny
neighbors who had strongly opposed it. The new Constitution was officially
adopted in 1830.</p>

<p>After the national census of 1840 had been taken, it revealed an unfair numerical
representation of the white people west of the Blue Ridge Mountains in
comparison with the representation of the number of white people living east
of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Such unfair representation existed in both houses
of the General Assembly to the extent that some residents even suggested that the
people of the western part of Virginia create a separate state and call it Appalachia.
Special local meetings were held and a referendum was finally suggested to determine
the need of a constitutional convention as an attempt to correct this unfair
condition. Finally, a state-wide vote in 1850 recommended such a convention be
held in Richmond in the same year. After numerous arguments among the
delegates had been voiced over a four months' period, a compromise was eventually
adopted. The national census of 1850 was to be used as the official white
population count and legislative representation was to be based upon this count:
the effect of the compromise was to give the counties west of the Blue Ridge
Mountains a majority in the House of Delegates and the counties east of the
Blue Ridge Mountains a majority in the State Senate. Additional reforms were
adopted which resulted in this 1850 convention sometimes being referred to as
"the reform convention": suffrage was extended considerably to white male
citizens; oral balloting was to be maintained; the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor,
the Attorney General, certain judges, county clerks and sheriffs were to be
elected directly by the qualified voters; the tenure of the Governor was extended
to a four-year term; and the General Assembly was to meet once every two years
instead of annually. A capitation or poll tax was to be levied upon each voter
and half of the revenue from this tax was to be used for school purposes. The
General Assembly was given additional power to control slavery by the passage
of certain restrictions which were to be imposed upon slaveowners. This third
Constitution for Virginia was officially adopted in 1851 after it had been ratified
by the voters of the state.</p>

<p>After the War between the States had ended and the Reconstruction Period
had begun, Virginia became Military District Number One in March 1867 with
General John M. Schofield as its chief executive. The United States Congress
demanded that Virginia and the other nine former seceded states rewrite their state
constitutions. When the delegates of the constitutional convention met on December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
3, 1867, they consisted of 32 Conservative Party members, 25 Radical
Republican Negroes, 14 native Virginia Radical Republicans and 31 Carpetbaggers,
Scalawags and aliens. The constitution which resulted from this convention
is known as the Underwood Constitution because the chairman of the
convention was Judge John C. Underwood, a Radical Republican. Some of the
provisions of this constitution included the division of each county into townships,
the establishment of a county court with a single judge in each county,
the appointment of a Board of Supervisors in each county to carry out the executive
powers, the levying of a high tax rate on landed property, the compulsory
creation of a public school system, the denial of suffrage to many former Confederate
leaders and a restriction of allowing only former non-supporters of the
Confederacy to hold office or act as a juror. In 1869, upon the recommendation
of President Ulysses S. Grant, the United States Congress allowed Virginia voters
to vote at a popular referendum on the Underwood Constitution itself and then
to vote separately on the sections which denied suffrage rights and office-holding
rights to former Confederates. On July 6, 1869, the qualified voters of Virginia
ratified the Underwood Constitution and rejected the other two sections.</p>

<p>In 1897, an attempt to hold a constitutional convention was defeated but three
years later, the people of the Commonwealth voted in favor of a constitutional
convention. This fifth constitutional convention began in June 1901 and continued
for approximately one year. As a result of this convention (described in
Chapter Four), numerous changes were made which were considered so important
by the delegates at the convention that they decided to "proclaim" this Constitution
of 1902 as the fundamental law of Virginia rather than to submit it to the
voters for ratification. Consequently, on May 29, 1902, the Constitution of 1902
was voted by the convention delegates for adoption and this is the present Constitution
of the Commonwealth, with certain subsequent revisions.</p>

<p>Like the Constitution of the United States, the Virginia Constitution is divided
into major areas called articles and into subdivisions called sections. There are
seventeen articles and two hundred and one sections. The following topics found
in the articles indicate the broad range of subjects included: the Bill of Rights,
Elective Franchise and Qualifications for Office, Division of Powers, Legislative
Department, Executive Department, Judiciary Department, Organization and
Government of Counties, Organization and Government of Cities and Towns,
Education and Public Instruction, Agriculture and Immigration, Public Welfare
and Penal Institutions, Corporations, Taxation and Finance, Miscellaneous Provisions&mdash;Homestead
and Other Exemptions, Future Changes in the Constitution,
Rules of Construction, and Voting Qualification of Armed Forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>The Virginia Bill of Rights</em></h3>

<p>Article I is the Bill of Rights. Such rights are prefaced by an introductory
paragraph in the article which states that this series of rights form the backbone
of the governmental structure in Virginia: "A declaration of rights made by the
good people of Virginia in the exercise of their sovereign powers, which rights do
pertain to them and to their posterity, as the basis and foundation of government."
The famous Declaration of Rights which follows the introductory paragraph was
written by George Mason and introduced at the Williamsburg Convention by
Archibald Cary. It was unanimously adopted by the convention members on
June 12, 1776, and its principles were considered so significant that they were
later used as the basis for the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the United
States as well as for many other state bills of rights. The importance attached to
these provisions has resulted in the Virginia Bill of Rights often being called the
"Magna Charta of Virginia."</p>

<p>In seventeen different sections, the Virginia Bill of Rights guarantees various
underlying principles of government:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) "That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have
certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they
cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity, namely, the enjoyment
of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and
pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety"&mdash;Thus, freedom and equality
of every individual is recognized, and one's rights of life, of liberty, of owning
property and of achieving happiness and safety are guaranteed.</p>

<p>(2) "That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people;
that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to
them"&mdash;Thus, a principle of democracy is expressed that the right to rule comes
from the people themselves and that office-holders are representatives of the
people and are responsible to the people.</p>

<p>(3) "That the government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit,
protection and security of the people, nation or community; of all the various
modes and forms of government, that is best which is capable of producing the
greatest degree of happiness and safety, and is most effectually secured against
the danger of maladministration; and, whenever any government shall be found
inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the community hath an
indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it, in
such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal"&mdash;Thus, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
objective of a government is to benefit, protect and preserve security for the
people. The best type of government is that which results in the greatest happiness
and safety of all those whom it governs. Whenever a majority of those
being governed consider such government as not attaining such an objective,
they have a right to change it, reform it, or, if deemed wise, to abolish it as long
as it is done in a legal manner considered for the good of all involved.</p>

<p>(4) "That no man, or set of men, is entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments
or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services;
which not being descendible, neither ought the offices of magistrate, legislator
or judge to be hereditary"&mdash;Thus, the amount of financial profit or gain received
by an office-holder in any community is to be based solely upon his
rendering public service to the community. Consideration of birth, influence
or wealth is to be ignored, and office-holding itself cannot be automatically
inherited or handed down from father to son.</p>

<p>(5) "That the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the State
should be separate and distinct; and that the members thereof may be restrained
from oppression, by feeling and participating the burthens of the people, they
should, at fixed periods, be reduced to a private station, return into that body
from which they were originally taken, and the vacancies be supplied by regular
elections, in which all or any part of the former members shall be again eligible,
or ineligible, as the laws may direct"&mdash;Thus, the principle of the separation of
powers is set forth, that is, the legislative, executive and judicial departments
are organized as three separate, independent departments. Officials should have
specific terms of office and should be elected for designated periods of time at
the end of which time they should return to their former private status and be
eligible for re-election if the law provides for such an opportunity.</p>

<p>(6) "That all elections ought to be free; and that all men having sufficient
evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community,
have the right of suffrage, and cannot be taxed, or deprived of, or
damaged in, their property for public uses, without their own consent, or that
of their representatives duly elected, or bound by any law to which they have
not, in like manner, assented for the public good"&mdash;Thus, all elections should
be free and open, and all men who have become regular residents of a community
should be allowed to vote. Property cannot be taxed, disposed of or
damaged for public use without the consent of the people involved or that of
their representatives. Neither can the people be forced to abide by any law
unless it has been voted upon by them or by their elected representatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>(7) "That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any
authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to
their rights and ought not to be exercised"&mdash;Thus, no office-holder should have
the authority to suspend a law or to carry out a law, independent of the legal
representatives of the citizenry.</p>

<p>(8) "That in criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause
and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses,
to call for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his
vicinage, without whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty. He
shall not be deprived of life or liberty, except by the law of the land or the
judgment of his peers; nor be compelled in any criminal proceeding to give
evidence against himself, nor be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense...."&mdash;Thus,
any man accused of a crime is entitled to certain rights: to be informed
of the charges placed against him, to meet face to face with the witnesses and
accusers, to defend himself in a fair and speedy trial with an impartial or unprejudiced
jury. He cannot be deprived of life or liberty except by legal judicial
action; he cannot be made to testify against himself; and he is ineligible to be
tried twice for the same crime.</p>

<p>(9) "That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed,
nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted"&mdash;Thus, bails, fines and
punishments must be reasonable.</p>

<p>(10) "That general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded
to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to
seize any person or persons not named, or whose offense is not particularly
described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive, and ought
not to be granted"&mdash;Thus, a search warrant should state specifically the exact
place to be searched or the exact individual to be seized and the offense should
be specified.</p>

<p>(11) "That no person shall be deprived of his property without due process
of law; and in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and
man, trial by jury is preferable to any other, and ought to be held sacred. The
General Assembly may limit the number of jurors for civil cases in courts of
record to not less than five in cases cognizable by justices of the peace, or to
not less than seven in cases not so cognizable"&mdash;Thus, since man has a right
to own property, he cannot be deprived of it without due course of law. In
certain types of lawsuits, trial by jury is believed the best legal procedure.</p>

<p>(12) "That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty,
and can never be restrained but by despotic governments; and any citizen may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible
for the abuse of that right"&mdash;Thus, the right of the freedom of press and of the
freedom of speech is advocated as long as an individual assumes the responsibility
for same.</p>

<p>(13) "That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,
trained to arms, is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free State; that
standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and
that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed
by, the civil power"&mdash;Thus, a militia promotes the safety of the people.
There are dangers of a standing army of professional men in peacetime, and,
even in wartime, the military group should be subject to civilian authority.</p>

<p>(14) "That the people have a right to uniform government; and, therefore,
that no government separate from, or independent of, the government of Virginia,
ought to be erected or established within the limits thereof"&mdash;Thus, the
people in the State should be governed by the same rules and regulations. No
other separate or independent government within Virginia other than the one
established by the State Constitution can be organized.</p>

<p>(15) "That no free government, or the blessings of liberty can be preserved
to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality
and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles"&mdash;Thus,
government, like men, must be guided by moral principles: namely,
justice, moderation, temperance, frugality and virtue. Without repeated adherence
to these moral precepts, free government cannot survive.</p>

<p>(16) "That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner
of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force
or violence; and, therefore, all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of
religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty
of all to practice Christian forbearance, love and charity toward each other"&mdash;Thus,
the right of the freedom of religion is advocated and guaranteed.</p>

<p>(17) "The rights enumerated in this bill of rights shall not be construed to
limit other rights of the people not therein expressed"&mdash;Thus, since there are
other rights not included in this Bill of Rights, this last section reminds the
people that there are additional rights not specifically included in this article.</p></blockquote>

<p>An understanding of the natural fundamental rights of a people as individuals,
as guaranteed by the Virginia Bill of Rights, causes one to appreciate deeply the
guarantees of liberty and freedom provided for the people of the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>Election Requirements, Offices and Procedures</em></h3>

<p>The extreme importance which the early Virginians attached to suffrage is
recognizable by the location of the voting qualifications in the Virginia Constitution.
Such qualifications directly follow the Bill of Rights as Article II and
include the following requirements:</p>

<p>(1) a citizen of the United States</p>

<p>(2) at least twenty-one years of age</p>

<p>(3) a resident of Virginia at least one year</p>

<p>(4) a resident of the county, city or town at least six months</p>

<p>(5) a resident of the voting precinct at least thirty days prior to the election</p>

<p>(6) the payment of an annual state capitation or poll tax of one dollar and
fifty cents to the county or city treasurer at least six months prior to the election;
the receipt of such payment is necessary for registration before voting. A resident
who, although eligible to vote at the age of twenty-one, has refrained from doing
so must pay a poll tax assessable against him for a maximum three years before
being able to vote. A new resident must pay only for each year or part of a year
spent in Virginia.</p>

<p>(7) the passing of a literacy test to prove one's ability to read and write in
English and to understand the functions of government</p>

<p>(8) proper registration at least 30 days before the election at the office of the
local Registrar of Elections which includes the presentation of one's poll tax
receipt, the filling in of certain required forms pertaining to personal history and
the swearing under oath of the truth of one's statements. Registration in Virginia
is now permanent so that after a resident citizen has properly registered, he does
not have to repeat this process unless he moves. A noteworthy provision of the
Constitution allows any person who is an active member of the United States
Armed Forces to be exempt from paying a poll tax and from registering as a prerequisite
to voting. Likewise, his poll taxes are cancelled and annulled for the
three years next preceding if he has an honorable discharge.</p>

<p>Certain persons are excluded by Article II from registering and voting: idiots,
insane persons, paupers, persons disqualified by crime or specific disabilities which
have not been removed, persons convicted of treason, felony, bribery, petit larceny,
obtaining money or property under false pretenses, embezzlement, forgery or
perjury. The General Assembly has the power, by a two-thirds vote, to remove
such disabilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Qualified citizens of Virginia have the opportunity to elect three types of
officials:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) national officials&mdash;the President and the Vice-President of the United
States (every four years), two United States Senators (normally, every six
years) and ten United States Representatives (normally, every two years).</p>

<p>(2) state officials&mdash;the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Attorney-General
(every four years), forty State Senators (every four years) and one hundred
House of Delegates members (every two years).</p>

<p>(3) local officials&mdash;County: Treasurer, Sheriff, Commonwealth Attorney,
Commissioner of the Revenue (every four years), County Clerk (every eight
years) and Assembly members or members of the Board of Supervisors; City:
Treasurer, Sergeant, Mayor, Councilmen, City Attorney for the Commonwealth,
City Commissioner of the Revenue (every four years) and Clerk of
the City Courts (every eight years).</p></blockquote>

<p>All elections by the people are by secret ballot. Generally, election officials
are sworn in office the day of the election; one of the judges opens the ballot box
publicly, turns it upside down to prove its emptiness, locks it and keeps it locked
until the voting polls are closed. At the beginning of the election day, the election
judges receive the registration books and the list of those citizens whose past three
years poll tax has been paid. The election clerk receives a poll book, a blank book
to be used for the official listing of the voters who come to the polls. After all
election officials have received their necessary clerical supplies and their instructions,
the polls are opened for voting. Thus, a citizen is immediately checked for
his proper registration and poll tax payments when he comes to vote. He then
receives a ballot which he alone marks secretly in a voting booth. Voting must be
performed carefully because a defaced, improperly marked ballot may be challenged
and thrown out. He folds his ballot to maintain secrecy and hands it
to an election judge who places it immediately in the ballot box. It is illegal for
a voter to be approached concerning a possible candidate any nearer than 100
feet from the polling place. Fifteen minutes before closing time for the polling
place, one of the election judges will loudly proclaim this fact in front of the
polling place. Exactly fifteen minutes later, the voting officially ends and only
ballot holders at this time are allowed to cast their vote.</p>

<p>After the polls are closed, all the unused ballots are placed in a special envelope
marked accordingly. The used ballots are tipped out of the ballot box onto the
table. All the election officials present check the complete emptiness of the box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Representatives of each of the political parties are allowed to watch the correct
counting of the votes. The election clerks make two sets of tally sheets which
include the names of all the candidates which appeared on the ballot and each
clerk keeps personal tally as the ballots are counted and the names of the candidates
voted for are called off by the election judges. The usual tally method is
used, and the word "tally" is spoken by each clerk as the diagonal fifth line is
drawn so that any mistakes in the count made by either clerk can be caught
quickly. Any time there is disagreement between the tally scores of the two clerks,
a complete recounting of the ballots for the candidate whose score disagrees must
take place. In case of a tie vote for a Congressman, Assemblyman, or county or
city official, the outcome is determined by the Election Board, often by the flip
of a coin. When all the votes have been tallied, an official written report is prepared
on the back of each poll book: it includes the number of votes cast individually
and totally for each candidate. This report is signed by the election judges
and the election clerks. These poll books plus the used ballots and the unused
ballots are submitted to the county or city clerk and later reviewed by the Board
of Elections. The successful candidates then receive a certificate of election which
makes them officially elected to their respective offices.</p>

<p>Every person qualified to vote is eligible to any office of the State, county, city
or other subdivision of the State wherein he resides except as stated otherwise
in the State Constitution. Persons eighteen years of age are eligible to the office
of notary public. The terms of all officers elected begin on the first day of February
after their election unless otherwise stated. The members of the General
Assembly and all officers, executive and judicial, elected or appointed, take the
following oath or affirmation: "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support
the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State of Virginia,
and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the
duties incumbent on me as &mdash;&mdash;, according to the best of my ability,
so help me God."</p>

<p>Any person who is registered and qualified to vote at the next succeeding regular
election is eligible to vote at any legalized primary election held for the nomination
of any candidate for office.</p>


<h3><em>Legislative, Executive and Judicial Departments</em></h3>

<p>The separation of powers theory in government is considered so important that
Article III of the Virginia State Constitution concerns solely this underlying
principle: namely, that the legislative, executive and judicial departments are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
be separate and distinct. To emphasize this idea, the Constitution further states
that neither department shall "exercise the powers properly belonging to either
of the others nor may any person exercise the power of more than one of them at
the same time."</p>

<p>The Legislative Department&mdash;Since one of the chief functions of a government
is to make laws, it is logical for Article IV of the Constitution to consist of
a detailed description of the Legislative Department: its composition, membership,
qualifications, powers and limitations.</p>

<p>The State legislature or legislative branch is called the General Assembly. It
is a bicameral legislature composed of an upper house, the Senate, and a lower
house, the House of Delegates. This legislative body has been in continuous
existence since 1619 and is believed to be the oldest one in the Anglo-Saxon
world and the second oldest Parliament in the entire world.</p>

<p>The Constitution requires that the Senate consist of not more than forty and
not less than thirty-three members, elected quadrennially (once every four years).
There are forty members in the present State Senate, and their term of office is
four years. They are elected to office by the qualified voters of the State Senatorial
Districts on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November of every
other odd-numbered year in which the Governor is not elected. Therefore, they
are elected during the mid-term of the Governor. The State Constitution requires
that the House of Delegates consist of not more than one hundred and not less
than ninety members. In the present House of Delegates, there are one hundred
members, and their term of office is two years. Members of the House are
elected to office by the qualified voters of the State House districts on the Tuesday
following the first Monday in November of every odd-numbered year.
Both the Senatorial and House of Delegates Districts are set up by the General
Assembly in that a special commission is appointed by the governor to do the
districting: this commission membership must be approved by the General Assembly.
The Constitution requires that reapportionment or redistricting take place
every ten years to offset population changes. The last reapportionment was made
in 1952; therefore, the next reapportionment or redistricting is due in 1962.
There are now thirty-six State Senatorial Districts, thirty-three of which are
entitled to one Senator each and seventy-six House of Delegates' districts, sixty-two
of which are entitled to one Delegate each.</p>

<p>Any qualified voter living in a Senatorial or in a House district is eligible for
election from that district to the General Assembly. However, no General Assembly
member can hold any other public office at the same time or be elected by this
assembly to any civil office of profit in the state during his term of office. Likewise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
an individual who holds a federal government or state government salaried
office or employment or the position of court judge, Commonwealth attorney,
sheriff, sergeant, treasurer, assessor of taxes, commissioner of revenue, collector
of taxes, or court clerk cannot be a member of either house of the General Assembly
during his continuance in office. If such an individual is elected to either
house of the General Assembly, his former office must be vacated. Two Constitutional
requirements are necessary: the individual must be a qualified voter
and must live in the district he represents.</p>

<p>The salaries of the members of the General Assembly are fixed by law and are
paid from the public treasury. Any act passed which provides for an increase of
legislative salary cannot take effect until the end of the term for which the members
voting thereon were elected. The present salary is $1080 per regular sixty-day
biennial session (plus $720 for expenses) for the House of Delegates members
and for the State Senators and $1,260 for the Speaker of the House of Delegates
and the President of the Senate.</p>

<p>The General Assembly meets at Richmond in regular session once every two
years on the second Wednesday in January in even-numbered years, directly
following the election of the members of the House of Delegates. The maximum
number of days in the regular session is sixty, but a session may be extended not
longer than thirty days if three-fifths of the members of each house concur. The
usual session, however, is sixty days in length. A special session may be called at
any time by proclamation of the Governor on his own initiative or by him at the
request of two-thirds of the members of both houses. Neither house can, without
the consent of the other, adjourn to another place nor for more than three days
while a session is still in progress. A quorum is necessary to do business and a
majority of the members of each house is considered as a quorum. However, a
small number may adjourn from day to day and they have the power to compel
the attendance of members according to the rules established by each house individually.
The House must organize itself at the outset of each session because its
members have been elected the preceding November. The Clerk of the previous
House serves until a new chairman has been chosen. Therefore, the Clerk calls
the House to order, calls the roll, and officially swears in the members.</p>

<p>The chairman of the House of Delegates is called the Speaker: he is chosen by
the House of Delegates members after a party caucus. The chairman of the
Senate is called the President of the Senate and the Lieutenant-Governor automatically
serves as chairman. In the absence of the Lieutenant-Governor or
whenever he finds it necessary to carry out the office of Governor, the Senate
chooses a president pro tempore (president for-the-time-being) from its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
membership. Each house of the General Assembly selects its own officers (Clerk,
Sergeant-at-Arms, two Door Keepers), settles its rules of procedures and directs
writs of election for filling vacancies which may occur during the General Assembly's
session. If vacancies occur during the recess period when the General Assembly
is not in session, the Governor may issue writs of election as prescribed by law.
Each house is responsible for determining its own rules and for judging the election,
qualifications, and returns of its own members; each house may punish its
members for disorderly conduct and may expel a member whenever two-thirds of
its members so concur.</p>

<p>The members of the General Assembly are entitled to certain privileges. They
are free from arrest during the session of their particular house except in cases
of treason, felony (a serious crime) or breach of the peace. They cannot be questioned
in any other place for any speech or debate in which they participate in
either house. Furthermore, they are free from arrest under any civil process during
the regular sessions of the General Assembly and during the fifteen days directly
preceding or directly following the session.</p>

<p>Each house of the General Assembly must keep a journal of its proceedings and
must publish it from time to time. Whenever one-fifth of the members present
express a desire to have the "yeas" and "nays" of their members on a specific
question recorded, such information must be entered in the journal. The Clerk
of each house has this important duty of journal-keeping. In addition, the Clerk
also prepares the payroll, keeps the docket and supervises the printing of the
legislative acts&mdash;hence, he is often called the "Keeper of the Rolls" of the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the chief purpose of any legislative body is to make laws.
In Virginia, every law must be introduced in the form of a bill. There are six
major steps in the process whereby a bill becomes a law:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) A bill may originate in either house. The legislator who sponsors it is
called the "Patron." It is customary for all appropriation bills to be introduced
in the House of Delegates; the Clerk of the house in which it originated assigns
a number to it. No regular bill can be introduced after the beginning of the
last three weeks of a session.</p>

<p>(2) The bill is then referred to the proper committee of each house. There
are twenty-one standing committees in the Senate and thirty-four standing
committees in the House of Delegates. In addition, there are a few joint standing
committees&mdash;Senators and Delegates serving together on a committee&mdash;including
an auditing committee, nominations and confirmations committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
printing committee and a library committee. The bill is considered carefully by
the proper committee and then reported back to the Clerk of the House.</p>

<p>(3) The bill is then printed by the house in which it originated. The
original bill is sent directly to the printer, and the copies are usually then
printed and distributed to the members the next day. When the Clerk, having
received the committee report, places the bill an the calendar, it is called the
first reading and only the title of the bill is read at this time.</p>

<p>(4) The bill is read in its entirety when its turn comes on the calendar and
the "Patron" explains carefully its contents. Detailed discussion may take
place and amendment, rejection, referral to another committee for further study
or approval occurs. If the bill is approved, it is then sent to be engrossed&mdash;the
contents of the bill is pasted on a large sheet of paper with the amendments
or suggestions included in the proper place for final examining. This entire
procedure is called the second reading.</p>

<p>(5) The third reading takes place when the bill is being considered for final
passage. The bill must be passed in both houses in a recorded vote of "aye" or
"nay" on a roll call with a majority of "ayes" from those voting: at least two-fifths
of the members elected to each house must be participants in the voting.
This is performed in Virginia by an electric voting machine. The names of the
members voting for and against must be entered on the official journal of each
house. Thus, a bill may be approved or rejected by either house. Frequently,
a conference committee has to be appointed to smooth out differences between
the two houses in regards to the details of a bill.</p>

<p>(6) After the bill has been passed by both houses, it is enrolled&mdash;that is,
printed in final form&mdash;and signed by the presiding officer of each house in the
presence of the house members. The bill is then sent to the Governor for his
consideration. (See Article V concerning the Executive Department.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Either house may amend a bill by an approved "aye" vote of a majority of those
voting (at least two-fifths of the total membership in each house is a required
minimum for voting).</p>

<p>In case of an emergency measure, a recorded "aye" vote in the official journals
of four-fifths of the members voting in each house may result in the omission of
the usual required printing and reading of the bill on three different calendar
days.</p>

<p class="center"><em>State Capitol at Richmond</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A recorded affirmative vote by a majority of all the members elected to each
house is necessary for the passing of any bills which create or establish a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
office, which create, continue or revive a debt or charge, or which concern public
monies or taxes. All tax bills must specifically state the tax requirements clearly.</p>

<p>Each law can include only one subject or object, and such subject or object
must be expressed in its title. In order to revive or amend a law, the title reference
alone cannot be used; the act revived or the section amended must be re-enacted
and published at length. After a bill has been successfully passed, it generally
cannot take effect until at least ninety days after the adjournment of the General
Assembly session during which it was enacted. Two exceptions to this restriction
exist: a general appropriation law and an emergency law. In these two instances,
the General Assembly by an official "aye" recorded vote, by a vote of four-fifths
of the members voting in each house, has the power to state the time such laws
are to take effect.</p>

<p>The House of Delegates has the right to bring impeachment charges against
the executive or judicial officers of the state. Impeachment charges may be
brought for malfeasance (unlawful or wrongful action) in office, corruption,
neglect of duty, or other high crimes or misdemeanors. Such charges are prosecuted
before the Senate which has the sole power to try impeachments. A two-thirds
affirmative vote of the senators present is necessary for conviction. If an
individual is convicted of impeachment charges, he is subject to the following
penalties: removal from office and disqualification from further office-holding
under the State. In addition, the individual is subject to indictment (a formal
charge of crime presented by a grand jury), trial, judgment and punishment
according to law. It is possible in Virginia for the Senate to try impeachments
during the recess of the General Assembly if the charges are preferred before
adjournment.</p>

<p>In addition to passing state laws, the General Assembly also has the responsibility
of electing (1) the judges of the Supreme Court of the State where terms
have expired and (2) the judges of all circuit, corporate and chancery courts.
Although the Governor appoints all the executive department heads, appointments
generally must be approved by the General Assembly and likewise, all
commission member appointments must be confirmed or rejected by the General
Assembly.</p>

<p>According to the Federal Constitution, each state is represented in the United
States Senate by two senators usually elected directly by the qualified voters of
the state. The number of representatives from each state in the United States
House of Representatives is based upon the proportional population of each state
to the others. According to the last national census, the state of Virginia is entitled
to ten members in the United States House of Representatives, based upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
population in proportion to the other states. In order to determine the sections of
the state each member will represent, the state legislatures usually are given the
power to divide their states into Congressional election districts as well as state
election districts. Therefore, the Virginia General Assembly has the power to
apportion the State into Congressional districts. Virginia has, at the present time,
ten Congressional election districts. The state Constitution provides that these
districts must "be composed of contiguous (adjacent) and compact territory containing
as nearly as practicable, an equal number of inhabitants."</p>

<p>Section 58 of Article IV of the Virginia Constitution is considered so significant
that it is required by the General Assembly to be included in the subject matter
of all schools in the state. Its significance lies in the provisions included in this
section which guarantee added protection to individual liberties by a series of
prohibitions on the General Assembly itself. These prohibitions include the
following:</p>

<p>(1) The General Assembly cannot suspend the writ of habeas corpus unless
when, in case of invasion or rebellion, such action is required for public safety.
Habeas corpus, literally, is a Latin expression meaning "You have the body"; a
writ is a written legal command or order. Therefore, a writ of habeas corpus is
an official order commanding a person who has another person in custody to
produce the body of such person who is being detained before a court; thus, any
person arrested or otherwise detained upon suspicion of crime has the right to
demand an immediate hearing in court with a view to determine officially whether
or not there is adequate ground for his detention. If the prisoner is then believed
to have been detained on insufficient grounds, he will be given his freedom;
otherwise, he will be held for trial, with or without release on bail. Consequently,
the writ of habeas corpus acts as a protection for each individual against possible
illegal or unlawful imprisonment.</p>

<p>(2) The General Assembly cannot pass a bill of attainder. In English law, a
bill of attainder was an act of Parliament which pronounced the sentence of
death against an accused person with consequent complete destruction of his
civil rights without even a trial being conducted. In the Seventeenth Century
these bills were commonly used in England. The writers of the Virginia Constitution
did not believe in having an individual punished or convicted of a crime
without a trial by jury in a court with proper jurisdiction. This prohibition guarantees
a fair trial and means that an individual is "not guilty" until proven "guilty"
of violating some law or constitutional provision.</p>

<p>(3) The General Assembly cannot pass an ex post facto law. "Ex post facto"
literally means "after the fact." An ex post facto law is defined by the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
States Supreme Court as one which "makes an action done before the passing of
the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal, and punishes such action."
Therefore, the legislature cannot pass criminal legislation after an alleged crime
has been committed that, if brought to bear against an accused person, would be
to his disadvantage. Retroactive criminal legislation which is not detrimental to an
accused person is permissible (for example, a law reducing a penalty). Therefore,
only those individuals who violated a law after a law has been passed are subject
to punishment.</p>

<p>(4) The General Assembly cannot pass a law impairing the obligation of contracts.
A contract is a formal agreement between two or more persons binding
them to a particular action. Such contracts play a most important role in society
today and must be regarded with utmost sincerity. The United States Constitution
specifically prohibits the states from passing any law which would impair the
obligation of contracts, would weaken their effect or would make them more
difficult to enforce.</p>

<p>(5) The General Assembly cannot pass a law abridging the freedom of speech
or of the press. Individuals are granted the right to participate in political discussion
and criticism and in the interchanging of ideas and opinions in general. This,
however, does not guarantee absolute freedom: one cannot utter or publish untruths,
incite insurrections, encourage the disobedience of laws, defame the government,
or give aid and comfort to foreign countries involved in war against the
United States. One can easily understand the necessity for such limitations to
freedom.</p>

<p>(6) The General Assembly cannot enact a law whereby private property would
be taken or damaged for public uses without just compensation. The General
Assembly has the authority to define the term "Public Uses." Originally in
Virginia, the courts decided this definition, but an amendment later transferred
this power from the courts to the General Assembly, making it a legislative rather
than a judicial decision. The sovereign power of a state to take private property
for public purposes with proper compensation is called the "right of eminent
domain." The General Assembly must abide by such a right. Therefore, a resident
in Virginia is guaranteed protection from having his private property seized from
him for unfair or unjust compensation. In case of a dispute over the fair value of
such property, the court decides the fair amount.</p>

<p>(7) The General Assembly cannot compel an individual to frequent or support
a particular religious place of worship and cannot force an individual to suffer
because of his religious beliefs or opinions. All individuals are to be guaranteed
their religious freedom and the General Assembly cannot require religious tests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
bestow certain privileges or advantages to a particular sect or denomination and
cannot pass any law requiring or authorizing any official church within the state.
Likewise, the General Assembly cannot levy taxes on the people forcing them
to support the activities of a particular church or the building program of any
house of worship. The General Assembly, therefore, is forbidden to interfere with
the religious belief and worship of the inhabitants within the state. Another section
of the Constitution forbids the General Assembly from incorporating churches
or granting charters of incorporation to any religious denomination.</p>

<p>These religious safeguards for a person's individual beliefs are primarily repetitions
of the provisions of Thomas Jefferson's "Statute of Virginia for Religious
Freedom." Since it is more difficult to change a provision of a constitution than
a statute or a law, these provisions were included in the Virginia Constitution for
emphasis and for a more enduring effect.</p>

<p>The General Assembly is also forbidden to authorize lotteries (the distribution
of prizes determined by chance or by lot) or to allow the residents of the state to
buy, sell, or transfer lottery tickets or chances.</p>

<p>An extremely important power of every state legislature is the creation of
political subdivisions within the state itself: namely, the counties. The Virginia
Constitution specifically provides for the formation, division and consolidation
of counties. A new county must have a minimum area of 600 square miles and
the county or counties from which it is formed cannot be less than 600 square
miles after the new county has been formed. No county can be reduced in population
below 8,000 people. Whenever any county has a length three times its
breadth, or has a length exceeding fifty miles, it may be divided at the discretion
of the General Assembly. Such added length can occur as a result of boundary
changes or the annexation of territory. The General Assembly may consolidate
existing counties upon the approval of a majority of the qualified voters of each
of these counties voting as a result of an election held for this specific purpose.
If the majority do not vote approval of consolidation, such consolidation cannot
take place.</p>

<p>Virginia had eight counties originally, dating from 1634: Accawmack (now
known as Accomack and Northampton), Charles City (now known as Prince
George County), Charles River (now known as York County), Elizabeth City
(ceased as a county in 1952), Henrico, James City (now known as Surry
County), Wamosquyoake (no longer in existence&mdash;existed only from 1634-1637)
and Warwick River (known as Warwick but ceased as a county in 1952).
In 1648, an Indian district called Chickacoan was formed into the County of
Northumberland. From these nine counties eventually 172 counties were created,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with the largest number, 116, created from Northumberland. The last
change in the number of counties occurred in 1952 when both Elizabeth City
County and Warwick County became first class independent cities, thus relinquishing
county status. At the present time, there are 98 counties in Virginia.
Furthermore, since 1788, nine counties became part of the present state of Kentucky,
fifty counties became part of the present state of West Virginia and fifteen
counties (including the two mentioned previously) went out of existence through
consolidation or other methods. The General Assembly has exercised and will
continue to exercise its power of county-making in Virginia.</p>

<p>In the Virginia Supreme Court case of Moss versus County of Tazewell, the
decision stated that "the power of the legislature of the State is supreme, except
so far as it is restrained by State or Federal Constitution." Therefore, a State
constitution is usually considered as a restraining agreement whereby the Federal
Constitution is considered as a granting agreement. Thus, the legislative body
of a State has all the powers not prohibited to it by the State or Federal Constitution.
A State constitution is often, therefore, a summary of what the state
legislative body may not do. The Virginia Constitution specifically states that
"the authority of the General Assembly shall extend to all subjects of legislation,
not herein forbidden or unrestricted; and a specific grant of authority in this Constitution
upon a subject shall not work a restriction of its authority upon the
same or any other subject." The principles described are further emphasized
in this quotation from the Virginia Constitution which follows: "The omission in
this Constitution of specific grants of authority heretofore conferred shall not be
construed to deprive the General Assembly of such authority, or to indicate a
change of policy in reference thereto, unless such purpose plainly appear."</p>

<p>There are several limitations placed upon the General Assembly by the Constitution:
the General Assembly cannot enact any local, special or private law in
the following instances (but can enact general laws in the same instances):</p>

<p>(1) for the punishment of crime,</p>

<p>(2) for providing a change of venue (the place where a trial is held) in civil
or criminal cases,</p>

<p>(3) for regulating the jurisdiction of, or changing the rules of, evidence in
any judicial proceeding,</p>

<p>(4) for changing county seats,</p>

<p>(5) for assessing and collecting taxes and for extending the time for assessment
or collection of taxes,</p>

<p>(6) for exempting property from taxation,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>(7) for postponing or diminishing any obligation or liability of any person,
corporation or association to the State or to any local unit of government,</p>

<p>(8) for refunding money lawfully paid into the treasury of the State or the
treasury of any local unit of government,</p>

<p>(9) for granting from the treasury of the State any extra compensation to
any public officer, servant, agent or contractor,</p>

<p>(10) for conducting elections or designating places of voting,</p>

<p>(11) for regulating labor, trade, mining or manufacturing, or the rate of interest
on money,</p>

<p>(12) for granting any pension,</p>

<p>(13) for creating, increasing or decreasing fees, salaries, percentages, or allowances
of public officers during the term for which they are elected or appointed,</p>

<p>(14) for declaring streams navigable or authorizing the constructions of booms
or dams or the removal of obstructions from such streams,</p>

<p>(15) for regulating fencing or the boundaries of land, or the running at large
of stock,</p>

<p>(16) for creating private corporations, or amending, renewing, or extending
their charters,</p>

<p>(17) for granting to any private corporation, association or individual any
special or exclusive right, privilege or immunity,</p>

<p>(18) for naming or changing the name of any private corporation or association,</p>

<p>(19) for forfeiting the charter of a private corporation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>General laws pertaining to the above subjects may be amended or repealed as
long as they do not have the effect of enactment of a special, private, or local law.</p>

<p>The General Assembly also has the power, by means of general law, to confer
upon boards of supervisors of counties and the councils of cities and towns powers
of local and special legislation insofar as the delegation of power is not inconsistent
with constitutional limitations.</p>

<p>Each time the regular session of the legislature is held, the General Assembly
appoints a standing committee, called the auditing committee which consists of
two members of the Senate and three members of the House of Delegates. The
chief function of this committee is to examine, at least once a year, the books of
the State Treasurer and other government executive officers whose duties concern
auditing or accounting for the State revenue and of the public institutions. This
committee reports the results of its investigations to the Governor and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
arrange for publication of results in two newspapers of general circulation. The
Governor himself submits such reports to the General Assembly at the beginning
of each session. The members of this committee have the right to employ accountants
to assist them in carrying out their investigations.</p>

<p>The Executive Department&mdash;Article V of the Virginia Constitution concerns
the Executive Department. The chief function of the Executive Department is
to enforce or carry out the laws. The highest executive officer in the State is the
Governor. He receives his position by direct election of the qualified voters on the
Tuesday following the first Monday in November of every other odd-numbered
year&mdash;at the same time and place as the election of the General Assembly members.
The term of office for a Governor is, therefore, four years. He is not eligible
for re-election to the same office during the succeeding term; in other words, a
Governor cannot succeed himself.</p>

<p>The Governor's term begins on the third Wednesday in January on the first
year after his election and ends on the Tuesday following the second Wednesday
in January of his fourth year. This timing allows a new Governor to come into
office one week after the General Assembly has convened for its regular session
and has had the opportunity to organize. The interval also affords an opportunity
for the outgoing Governor to present his opinions and experiences to the state
legislature before his departure.</p>

<p>After the votes have been cast for the State gubernatorial (Governor) candidates,
the returns of the election are usually sent, under seal, to the Secretary
of the Commonwealth. He delivers the returns to the Speaker of the House of
Delegates on the first day of the next session of the General Assembly. Within
three days, the Speaker of the House of Delegates must open the returns in the
presence of a majority of the Senate and of the House of Delegates. Then the
votes are counted. The person who receives the highest number of votes is declared
elected. If there is a tie, however, the two houses of the General Assembly jointly
vote for the Governor.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for the governorship, a candidate must have three qualifications:
(1) he must be a United States citizen (if not a native-born citizen,
he must have been naturalized for at least ten years preceding his election),
(2) he must be at least thirty years of age and (3) he must have been a resident
in the State of Virginia for at least five years directly preceding his election.</p>

<p>The Governor must live in the city of Richmond, the capital of Virginia, during
his term of office. He resides at the Executive Mansion and receives at the
present time a salary of $20,000 per year. Such compensation cannot be increased
or diminished during his term of office. He cannot receive any other emolument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
(money) while in office from the state government or from any other government
and he cannot hold any other position while he is Governor of the State.</p>

<p>The chief duty or power of the Governor is to faithfully administer or execute
the laws. Other powers include:</p>

<p>(1) reporting to each session of the General Assembly the condition of the
State in a message known as the "Governor's Message"</p>

<p>(2) recommending to the General Assembly for consideration measures which
he believes are beneficial to the State</p>

<p>(3) convening the General Assembly whenever two-thirds of the members
of both houses request it</p>

<p>(4) convening the General Assembly into special session whenever, in his
opinion, the interest of the State requires it</p>

<p>(5) acting as the commander-in-chief of the State land and naval forces</p>

<p>(6) calling out the State militia or State Police whenever necessary to repel
invasion, suppress insurrection and enforce the execution of the laws</p>

<p>(7) conducting all relations with other states</p>

<p>(8) during the recess of the General Assembly, suspending from office for
misbehavior, incapacity, neglect of official duty, or acts performed illegally, any
executive officer in Richmond except the Lieutenant-Governor (whenever he
exercises this power, however, he must report to the General Assembly, at the
beginning of the next session, the fact that he suspended an officer or officers and
the cause for such suspension: then the General Assembly itself determines
whether or not such individuals are to be restored or finally removed from office).</p>

<p>(9) during the recess of the General Assembly, appointing pro tempore (temporary)
successors to all individuals suspended (as described previously)</p>

<p>(10) likewise, during the recess of the General Assembly, filling pro tempore
vacancies in all offices of the State if such filling is not otherwise provided for by
the Constitution or by laws. (Such appointments must be by commissions which
automatically expire at the end of thirty days after the beginning of the next
session of the General Assembly).</p>

<p>(11) remitting fines and penalties under rules and regulations as prescribed
by law</p>

<p>(12) granting reprieves and pardons after conviction except those in which
the House of Delegates carried on the prosecution</p>

<p>(13) removing political disabilities resulting from conviction for offenses committed
prior to or subsequent to the adoption of the State Constitution</p>

<p>(15) informing the General Assembly, at each session, of the details of each
case of fine or penalty remitted, of each reprieve or pardon granted, and of punishment
commuted, plus his reason for doing so.</p>

<p>(16) requiring information in writing, under oath, from the officers of the
executive department and superintendents of State institutions upon any subject
relating to the duties of their respective offices and institutions (Likewise, he may
inspect at any time their official books, accounts and vouchers, and ascertain the
conditions of the public funds in their charge and he may employ accountants
for this purpose)</p>

<p>(17) requiring the opinion in writing of the State Attorney-General concerning
any question of law affecting his official duties as Governor or relating to the
affairs of the Commonwealth</p>

<p>(18) legally certifying all commissions and grants in the name of the Commonwealth
of Virginia and affixing each with the official seal of the Commonwealth</p>

<p>(19) supervising the activities of all State Executive Departments, Divisions,
Boards and Commissions and appointing all the chief officers and members of
such groups with the consent or confirmation of the General Assembly</p>

<p>(20) appointing certain officials, subject to confirmation by the General
Assembly (for example, the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the State Treasurer)</p>

<p>(21) considering all bills passed by the General Assembly</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Governor's responsibility in the law-making process is significant. After a
bill has passed both houses of the General Assembly, it is sent to the Governor
who has four choices of action:</p>

<p>(1) He may approve the bill by signing it; it becomes a law.</p>

<p>(2) He may disapprove the bill by vetoing it; he then returns it with his objections
to the house in which it originated. This house enters such objections on
its journal and reconsiders the bill in view of such objections. If, after careful
consideration, two-thirds of the members present (at least a majority of the
membership of that house is required as a minimum present for voting) still approve
the bill, it is sent with the Governor's objections to the other house. After
careful consideration here, if it is approved by two-thirds of all the members
present (at least a majority of the membership of this house is also required as
the minimum present for voting), it will become a law over the Governor's disapproval.
This process is called "Over-riding the Veto." The Governor also has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the power to veto any particular item or items of an appropriation bill without
vetoing the entire bill. Such veto affects only the particular item or designated
items. In such a case, the item or items must be considered by the same methods
described previously. If the Governor favors the general purpose of any bill but
opposes a part or certain parts, he may return it with recommendations for amending
it to the house in which is originated with the same procedures described previously
being used. One exception, however, exists: a vote of only a majority
of the members present in each house is required to amend a bill.</p>

<p>(3) He may do nothing about the bill; after five days have passed, Sundays
excepted, and if the General Assembly is still in session, the bill automatically
becomes a law.</p>

<p>(4) He may do nothing about the bill; after ten days have passed, if the General
Assembly has adjourned in the meantime, making it impossible to return the
bill, the bill does not become a law. Such procedure is called a "pocket veto."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With such a wide range of power, the tremendous responsibility and authority
which the Governor of Virginia possesses is readily apparent.</p>

<p>The second highest ranking state executive is the Lieutenant-Governor. He
is elected to office by the qualified voters at the same time as the Governor for the
same four-year term of office. His qualifications and election procedure are identical
to those of the Governor. In case the Governor of the state dies, fails to
qualify, resigns, is removed from the State or is unable to discharge the powers
and duties of his office, the Lieutenant-Governor then assumes the Governorship
with its duties, powers and compensation. Normally, the chief duty of the Lieutenant-Governor
is to act as permanent chairman of the State Senate. While
presiding over same, he is called the President of the Senate. In such capacity,
he has no vote except in case of a tie. His salary consists of $1260 for each
biennial session of the legislature plus $3,000 per year for traveling expenses.
Hence, he receives the same salary as the Speaker of the House of Delegates.</p>

<p>Two major administrative officials appointed by the Governor and subject to
the approval of the General Assembly are the Secretary of the Commonwealth
and the State Treasurer. Their terms of office are coincident with the Governor
who appoints them. The Secretary of the Commonwealth acts as the official secretary
to the Governor and is the head of the Division of Records where all records
of the official acts of the Governor are kept. The Secretary of the Commonwealth
is also the custodian of the official State Seal and is responsible for affixing same
to all the official documents signed by the Governor. The State Treasurer has
custody of the funds of the state in the payment of bills. He makes deposits of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
revenue belonging to the Commonwealth in certain specified banks and withdraws
such money by check only upon the State Comptroller's warrant.</p>

<p>Another important state official is the Auditor of Public Accounts. He is
elected by the joint vote of both houses of the General Assembly for a four-year
term. His powers and duties include the auditing of all accounts of each state
department, institution and agency, and he acts as chief auditor and accountant
of the Auditing Committee of the General Assembly. In addition, he is responsible
for exposing unauthorized, illegal or unwise handling of state funds to
the Governor, the Auditing Committee of the General Assembly and the Comptroller.
He is also required by law to audit all city and county officials' accounts
unless such accounts are audited annually by a certified public accountant according
to the State Auditor's instructions.</p>

<p>All state officials who collect, keep in custody, handle or disburse public funds
must give bond for the faithful performance of these duties. The amount of the
bond varies with the amount of revenue involved in carrying out such duties.</p>

<p>Any individual who is appointed to any office by the Governor which requires
confirmation by the General Assembly and who does not receive such necessary
confirmation cannot start or continue in office and is ineligible for reappointment
during the recess of the General Assembly to fill a vacancy caused by such refused
confirmation.</p>

<p>To assist the Governor in carrying out his executive duties, numerous departments
and agencies have been established by the Constitution or by legislative
act. Most of the department names suggest the particular type of work for which
each is responsible: the Department of Military Affairs, the Department of Law
including the Division of Motion Picture Censorship and the Division of War
Veterans' Claims, the Department of Accounts, the Department of Purchases and
Supply, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Taxation, the Department
of State Police, the Division of Motor Vehicles, the Department of
Corporations, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the Department of
Labor and Industry, the Department of Agriculture and Immigration, the Department
of Workmen's Compensation, the Department of Conservation and Economic
Development, the Department of Education, the Department of Highways,
the Department of Health, the Department of Welfare and Institutions, the
Department of Mental Hygiene and the Department of Professional and Occupational
Registration. The Division of Personnel, the Division of the Budget,
the Division of Records and the Office of Civilian Defense are all located in the
Governor's Office. Additional specialized commissions such as the Advisory Council
on Virginia Economy, the Art Commission, the Safety Codes Commission, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
State Library Board, the State Water Control Board, the Commission on Constitutional
Government, the Potomac River Basin Commission and the Commission
on Interstate Cooperation also participate actively in the carrying out of the
financial, law enforcing, service rendering, conservation, preservation, and regulation
functions of the executive department of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The Judicial Department&mdash;Article VI concerns the Judiciary Department
whose chief purpose is to interpret the laws properly. The State Constitution in
Virginia provides for a Supreme Court of Appeals, Circuit Courts, City Courts
and other inferior courts. The jurisdiction of these courts is regulated by law with
the exception of jurisdiction granted specifically by the State Constitution itself.
The General Assembly authorizes by law the appointment of judges pro tempore
by the Governor.</p>

<p>The highest State Court is the Supreme Court of Appeals, located in Richmond.
It consists of seven members: one Chief Justice and six associate justices.
The Chief Justice is always the Senior Justice in years of continuous service; in
case the total years of service are equaled by two or more justices, seniority is then
determined by age. The term of office of the justice is twelve years, and they are
elected by a joint vote of the Senate and the House of Delegates. Their sole constitutional
qualification is that they must have held a "judicial station" in the
United States or have practiced law in Virginia or some other state for five years
previously. The annual salary of a justice of the Court of Appeals is $15,500
with the Chief Justice receiving an additional $4,500 or a salary of $20,000.</p>

<p>When meeting in court session, the members of the Supreme Court of Appeals
may sit as an entire group or may sit in two divisions consisting of not less than
three justices each. By sitting in two such divisions, it is possible to hear more
cases at a rapid pace. Whenever convening in this manner, each division has the
full power and authority on the determination of causes, in the issuing of writs,
and in the exercise of all powers authorized by the State Constitution for the
Supreme Court of Appeals or provided by law. Each division is subject, however,
to the general control of the Supreme Court of Appeals and is subject to any rules
and regulations which this court may make. Likewise, the decision of either
division does not become the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals unless
concurred in by at least three judges. Any case which involves a construction of
the State Constitution or of the Constitution of the United States must be decided
upon by the Supreme Court of Appeals in toto and, furthermore, the assent of
at least four of the judges is necessary for the court to determine that any law is
or is not contrary to the State Constitution or the Constitution of the United
States. If, in such a case, it is impossible for more than three of the judges to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
agree on the constitutional questions involved and if the case cannot be determined
without passing on such questions, the case must be reheard by a full
court. Whenever the judges within either division differ as to the judgment to
be rendered in any cause, or whenever any judge of either division within a time
and in a manner fixed by the court rules certifies that in his opinion any decision
of any division of the court is in conflict with a prior decision of the court, the
cause must be considered and adjudged (decreed) by the full court or at least
a quorum of the full court.</p>

<p>There are two types of court jurisdiction: original and appellate. Original
jurisdiction exists whenever a court has the legal right to hear a case for the first
time. Appellate jurisdiction exists whenever a court is hearing a case which is
being appealed or brought to it from a lower court. The Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals has original jurisdiction in cases of habeas corpus, mandamus and
prohibition. Habeas corpus is a court order which commands a person having
another individual in custody to bring before the court the individual detained
for the purpose of determining the legality of detention. A mandamus is a court
order directed to subordinate courts, corporations, or the like, commanding them to
do something therein specified. A prohibition is a writ or court order which legally
restrains someone from doing some particular action. In all other cases in which
the Supreme Court of Appeals has jurisdiction, it has appellate jurisdiction only.
The General Assembly has the power to provide, from time to time, for a Special
Court of Appeals whose chief purpose is to assist the Supreme Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Whenever a judgment or decree is reversed, modified or affirmed by the Supreme
Court of Appeals, the court must state in writing the reasons for same and
must keep such record on file with the case. In criminal matters, the court may
direct a new trial. If the court believes that the accused should be discharged
from further prosecution, in such instance, it has the right to order the case ended,
thereby discharging such an individual from further prosecution. This court has
no power, however, to increase or decrease the punishment of an accused person.
In civil cases, the court may enter a final judgment.</p>

<p>The courts which rank second highest in the Virginia judiciary are the Circuit
Courts. The General Assembly has the power to arrange and re-arrange the judicial
circuits of the state and to increase or diminish their number. However, no
new circuit can be created containing less than forty thousand inhabitants according
to the most recent census nor if such creation would result in reducing the
number of inhabitants in any existing judicial circuit below forty thousand. There
are thirty-seven judicial circuits in Virginia. The geographical composition of the
circuit ranges from one county or city to five counties and one city. Each circuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
has one judge chosen by the joint vote of both houses of the General Assembly
for a term of eight years. He must possess the same qualifications when chosen as
judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals and must live in the circuit area where
the circuit court is located while he is in office. The number of sessions of the
circuit courts to be held for each county and city is prescribed by law and the
judge of one circuit may be required or authorized to hold court in another circuit
or city. Circuit courts usually have original and appellate jurisdiction in (1) all
civil cases involving twenty dollars or more and (2) certain criminal cases.</p>

<p>Below the circuit courts in the court structure in Virginia are the city Hustings
or Corporation Courts. They are courts of record also and have original jurisdiction
except in cases of appeals from justices. These courts have the sole power
to appoint electoral boards in cities where they are located. They have much
concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts. They are criminal courts and can
try cases of felonies committed within one mile of the corporation limits. There
are sixteen such courts: Corporation Courts located in Alexandria, Bristol, Charlottesville,
Danville, Lynchburg, Newport News, Norfolk (2), South Norfolk,
Staunton, and Winchester; Hustings Courts located in Petersburg, Portsmouth,
Richmond (2) and Roanoke. These city court judges must live in the city where
the court is located.</p>

<p>The Virginia Constitution divides the cities of Virginia into two classes as far
as the judicial system is concerned: (1) cities having a population of at least ten
thousand according to the last official census are called cities of the first class;
(2) cities having a population of less than ten thousand according to the last
official census are called cities of the second class. In each first class city there
may be a corporation court in addition to a circuit court. In any city containing
at least thirty thousand inhabitants, the General Assembly may provide additional
courts with the number of judges it deems necessary for the public interest.</p>

<p>In a second class city, there may be a corporation or hustings court. The circuit
court of the county in which the city is situated and the corporation or hustings
court have concurrent jurisdiction in actions at law and suits in equity unless
otherwise provided by law. Therefore, the General Assembly has the power to
confer exclusive original jurisdiction upon a corporation or hustings court in all
cases involving residents of any such city; this setup is much more convenient to
the residents who live a considerable distance from the county seat. This type of
court may be abolished by a vote of a majority of the qualified voters of the particular
city in which the court is located at a special election held for this purpose.
Another method by which a court may cease to exist is by having the office of
judge of such a court whose annual salary is less than eight hundred dollars become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
vacant and remain vacant for ninety days consecutively. Automatic abolishment
of such court results. In each case in which such court is abolished, the
city immediately comes within the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the county
wherein it is geographically situated unless otherwise provided for by law. The
records of the abolished corporation or city court immediately become records of
the aforementioned circuit court and are transferred accordingly.</p>

<p>For each city court of record there is a judge chosen for an eight-year term by
a joint vote of both houses of the General Assembly. He must have the same
qualifications as Supreme Court of Appeals judges and must live within the jurisdiction
of the court over which he presides while he is in office. However, the
judge of a corporation court of any corporation having a city charter and having
less than ten thousand inhabitants may live outside the city limits. Such an individual
may be judge of such corporation court and also judge of a corporation
court of some other city having less than ten thousand inhabitants. The judges of
city courts may be required or authorized to hold the circuit or city courts of any
county or city.</p>

<p>The General Assembly has the power also to establish courts of land registration
for the administration of any law it may adopt for the purpose of the
settlement, registration, transfer, or assurance of titles to land in the State.</p>

<p>Judges are commissioned by the Governor of the State. Their salaries and
allowances are prescribed by law and cannot be diminished during their term of
office. Their term of office begins on the first day of February succeeding their
election by the General Assembly. Whenever there is a judgeship vacancy, the
successor is elected for the unexpired term. The General Assembly also has the
authority to retire judges and to provide their compensation. The General Assembly
has the power to pass laws giving duties to retired judges such as substitute
judge work. The salaries of judges are paid out of the State treasury but the State
is reimbursed for one-half of the salaries of each of the circuit judges by the
counties and cities composing the circuit, based upon their population and of
each of the judges of a city of the first class by the city in which each judge presides.
The one exception is the judge of the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond
whose entire salary is paid by the State. A city may increase the salary of
its circuit or city judges if the city assumes the entire increase and guarantees that
such salary will not be diminished during the entire term of office. A city which
has less than ten thousand inhabitants pays the salary of its city judge.</p>

<p>Judges may be removed from office in Virginia for cause by a concurrent vote
of both houses of the General Assembly. A majority of all the members elected
to each house must concur in such vote, and the cause of removal must be entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
on the journal of each house. The judge against whom the General Assembly is
about to proceed for removal must have notice of same accompanied by a copy
of the alleged causes at least twenty days before the actual voting takes place.
Typically, no judge can practice law within or without the State of Virginia nor
hold any other office of public trust while he is in office.</p>

<p>Writs (court orders) must be issued in the name of the "Commonwealth of
Virginia" and must be certified by the clerks of the various courts. The Constitution
requires that indictments (a formal charge of crime presented by a grand
jury) conclude "against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth."</p>

<p>The General Assembly provides for the appointment or the election of justices
of the peace and establishes their jurisdiction. Authority of justices of the peace
includes civil suits which involve limited amounts. In addition, Virginia also has
police justices, trial justices, civil justices, civil and police justices, juvenile and
domestic relations courts and mayor's courts. Their jurisdiction is usually limited,
however, and appeals from them are heard by city and circuit courts.</p>

<p>All cities and counties and many towns have local courts called Magistrate
Courts or Justice of the Peace Courts. Their jurisdiction includes misdemeanors
and civil cases involving small amounts of money.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth also has two Law and Chancery Courts, one located in
Roanoke and one in Norfolk. Their jurisdiction includes the probating of wills
and the settling of estates. There is a special Chancery Court located in Richmond
which has complete charge of wills to be probated and the settling of estates in
that part of "Richmond north of the south bank of the James River." There is
also a special Law and Equity Court located in Richmond.</p>

<p>The Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, located in Norfolk, is a special
state court which has jurisdiction over cases involving dependent, neglected and
delinquent children and in cases involving crimes&mdash;except manslaughter&mdash;against
a family member.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>Virginia</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The State Attorney-General is elected by the qualified voters of the State at
the same time and for the same term as the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor
of the State (a four-year term of office). He must have the same qualifications
as the Governor but he is eligible for re-election. His chief duty is to serve as
the attorney-at-law for the State; he renders opinions concerning the interpretation
and application of laws upon the request of the Governor or of various Department
heads, he presents cases to the Supreme Court of Appeals if the State's
interest is involved and he represents the State of Virginia before the Supreme
Court of the United States. The numerous problems arising in the carrying out
of these responsibilities make it desirable and necessary for him to have legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
assistants who may aid him in furnishing aid to local Commonwealth attorneys.
The State Attorney-General is subject to removal from office in the same manner
as judges. His present salary is $17,000 annually.</p>


<h3><em>Local Governmental Units</em></h3>

<p>The State Constitution not only establishes state government organization, but
it also includes rules concerning local governmental units which are found in
Article VII. Local charters are granted by the General Assembly. The political
level immediately below the state government level is the county. Virginia is
divided into ninety-eight counties at the present time. The last original county
to be created is Dickenson County, formed in 1880. The largest county in the
state in area is Pittsylvania with 1,022 square miles and the smallest county in
area is Arlington with 24 square miles. Fairfax County is currently the most
populated county in Virginia, surpassed in population only by the city of Norfolk.</p>

<p>Legally, a county is a corporation. Its main functions, in general, are the
preservation of order, the protection of life and property, the establishment of
public schools, the administration of justice, the registration of legal documents,
the maintenance of highways and bridges outside the cities and the care of the
poor and the criminal.</p>

<p>Counties of Virginia are divided into magisterial districts, the number of districts
varying from three to ten. Provision is made in the state constitution that
additional districts may be made by law only if the new district contains at least
30 square miles. Each district has one supervisor elected by the qualified voters.
Thus, the Board of Supervisors of the county consists of one representative elected
from each magisterial district in the county with the exception of Arlington
County where the Board of Supervisors is elected at-large from the county.
Therefore, the number of members of each Board of Supervisors varies among
the counties. A chairman for this group is selected by the members themselves.
Their meetings are usually held once a month at the Court House located at the
County Seat. The Board of Supervisors carries out various duties such as: (1)
supervises county affairs, (2) establishes and levies county taxes, (3) prepares
the county budget, (4) audits claims against the county, (5) erects and maintains
county buildings, (6) acts as a legislative and executive body by issuing and
carrying out ordinances on such subjects as sanitation, health and police, (7)
approves saluary scales for county workers, (8) controls county property, (9)
furnishes care for the mentally and physically handicapped, and (10) borrows
money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>There are five county officials of importance who are elected to office by the
qualified voters on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November and
take office on January 1 following their election. These officials are:</p>

<p>(1) Attorney for the Commonwealth&mdash;a lawyer who acts as a legal adviser to
the Board of Supervisors and to the county officials and who acts as legal representative
of the people of the county; he also acts as prosecutor for all civil and
criminal cases in which the county is interested; he is elected by the qualified
voters for a four-year term.</p>

<p>(2) County Clerk&mdash;an officer who serves as a clerk to the County Board of
Supervisors and to the County Circuit Court; as the main county recording official,
he records all types of county documents (such as deeds, wills, judgments,
mortgages, births, divorces, deaths, elections, court trials and marriages); attends
meetings of the Board of Supervisors and has custody of property records; he is
elected by the qualified voters for an eight-year term.</p>

<p>(3) Commissioner of the Revenue&mdash;an official who assesses property values for
taxation purposes, assesses State personal income taxes, prepares personal property
tax books and land books and assesses and collects all professional and business
licenses; he is elected by the qualified voters for a four-year term.</p>

<p>(4) County Treasurer&mdash;an officer who collects the county taxes assessed by
the Commissioner of Revenue, collects the state taxes, keeps the county funds
and disburses money upon order of the Board of Supervisors; he is elected by the
qualified voters for a term of four years.</p>

<p>(5) Sheriff&mdash;an officer who is the chief executive officer of the county; he and
his assistants, called deputies, form the county police force; the Sheriff serves
warrants of arrests, summons witnesses and jurors whenever necessary, preserves
peace in the county, has charge of prisoners, cooperates with the State Police and
acts as a Bailiff at meetings of the Board of Supervisors and at Trial Justice and
Circuit Court sessions; he is elected for a four-year term.</p>

<p>Other significant county positions include County School Board members,
County Superintendent of Schools, County Health Board members, County
Surveyor, Welfare Board members, Planning Commission and Highway Commission
members, Game Wardens and Election Board members. A state official
who exerts strong influence upon the county is the State Circuit Judge. Since he
tries cases in various counties within his own circuit, he comes in contact with
many county officials and has the authority to appoint certain county officials
within his own circuit such as (1) a Trial Justice who tries the less important civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and criminal cases in the county and holds hearings of cases to be tried by the
circuit judge and (2) the Coroner who makes investigations and reports concerning
sudden, violent or suspicious deaths in the county. The Circuit Judge also
appoints the School Trustee Electoral Board which in turn appoints the County
School Board.</p>

<p>There are three types or forms of County Government in existence in Virginia:
the County Executive Form, the County Manager Form and the County Board
(often called the "Traditional") Form. Two counties, Albemarle and Fairfax,
have adopted the County Executive Form and two counties, Arlington and
Henrico, have adopted the County Manager Form. Arlington County was the
first county in the United States to adopt the County Manager form of government
by popular vote (1932). The major difference between the County Executive
and the County Manager Forms of government is found in the fact that, in
the former type, the Board of Supervisors makes all key appointments upon the
recommendations of a county executive who is employed to act as the administrative
head of the county whereas, in the latter form, the Board of Supervisors
employs a manager for the county and gives him authority to name and appoint
his own department heads. The remaining 94 counties are operated under a
County Board: under this form, the Board of Supervisors exercises not only legislative
but full executive authority as well.</p>

<p>The county form of government, therefore, acts not only as a local government
unit but also as an administrative agent of the state.</p>

<p>Cities and towns make up the next political level of government organization
in Virginia as described in Article VIII of the constitution. A city is defined
in the constitution as an incorporated community which has within defined boundaries
a population of five thousand or more; a town is an incorporated community
which has within defined boundaries a population of less than five thousand. In
determining such population, the last census of the United States or an enumeration
made by authority of the General Assembly must be used as the basis. Any
incorporated community which had a city charter when this section of the State
Constitution was adopted in 1902, regardless of its numerical population at the
time, was allowed to keep its city charter. The General Assembly has the authority
to enact general laws for the organization and government of cities and towns in
Virginia. In special instances, the Circuit Court may issue such charters. Whenever
an area has a population of at least five thousand, it may apply, but is not
required to apply, for city status. Unlike many of the other states in the United
States, Virginia does not have any village type of government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Cities having at least ten thousand persons are eligible to be classified as cities
of the first class; cities having less than ten thousand persons are eligible to be
classified as the second class. Cities in Virginia have generally followed a three-fold
plan or pattern of development: first, an area is established, then incorporated
as a town and finally elevated to city status as an independent municipality. During
the colonial period, there were only two towns actually incorporated: Williamsburg
and Norfolk. By 1800, only six additional towns were incorporated: Alexandria,
Winchester, Fredericksburg, Richmond, Petersburg and York (Yorktown).
Yorktown is the only town incorporated before 1800 which has not become
a city.</p>

<p>A unique characteristic about cities in Virginia is the fact that an incorporated
city is politically separate from the county in which it is geographically located.
There are thirty-two independent cities: Alexandria, Bristol, Buena Vista, Charlottesville,
Clifton Forge, Colonial Heights, Covington, Danville, Falls Church,
Fredericksburg, Galax, Hampton (formerly, a second class city; now combined
with the town of Phoebus and Elizabeth City County into a first class city since
1952), Harrisonburg, Hopewell, Lynchburg, Martinsville, Newport News, Norfolk,
Norton, Petersburg, Portsmouth, Radford, Richmond, Roanoke, South
Boston, South Norfolk, Staunton, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Waynesboro, Williamsburg
and Winchester. When Newport News and Warwick became the city
of Newport News on July 1, 1958, this was the first city to be consolidated in
the Commonwealth since Richmond and Manchester combined in 1910.</p>

<p>There are three types or forms of City Government in existence in Virginia:
Mayor-Council form, Commission form and City Manager form. The city charter
bears a similar relation to the city that the Virginia Constitution bears to the
state. The citizens within the city area may decide for themselves the type of city
government they prefer when they apply for their city charter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although there are three forms of local government available, there are certain
characteristics common to all three types:</p>

<p>(1) A bicameral City Council (unless authorized by the General Assembly
to have only one branch) is elected by the qualified voters of the city on the
second Tuesday in June. The term of office of the councilmen begins on the
following September 1. The council acts as the legislative body by passing city
or municipal laws called ordinances. Cities are usually divided into various sections
called wards. Since representation from each ward is primarily based upon
population of the ward, the city council has the power to change ward boundaries.
Since 1933, after every ten-year period, the city council is required by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the Virginia Constitution to re-apportion such representation accordingly. Usually,
there is one councilman from each ward.</p>

<p>(2) The following officials are required by the Constitution to be elected to
office by the qualified voters: City Court Clerk, City Commonwealth's Attorney,
City Commissioner of Revenue, City Treasurer and City Sergeant (Sheriff). All
these officials (with the exception of the City Court Clerk whose eight-year term
of office begins at the same time as the city judges' term) are elected on the first
Tuesday after the first Monday in November and their term of office begins on
the following January 1. Under a constitutional amendment proposed in November
1960, certain elected officials of a city (or county) could serve as such officials
in two or more cities (or counties, or city and counties) if a majority of the voters
of the local units affected so decided; however, the amendment was defeated.</p>

<p>(3) Every city has a mayor who is the chief executive and who is elected by
the people for a four-year term. Depending upon the form of city government
adopted, the mayor may be essentially a figurehead or a key official. The chief
duties of a mayor usually include the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>a. enforcing ordinances, by-laws and orders,</p>

<p>b. ascertaining that duties of various city officials are carried out properly,</p>

<p>c. suspending city officials upon the authorization of the General Assembly
for misconduct in office or for neglect of duty,</p>

<p>d. considering ordinances, resolutions, and other measures and approving or
disapproving them,</p>

<p>e. presiding at city council meetings (unless a special provision already has
provided for a council president) and voting only in case of a tie</p>

<p>f. appointing key officials with the approval of the city council (for example,
the Chief of Police, the Fire Chief, the City Attorney) and members of
certain boards (Planning, Health, Zoning Boards).</p></blockquote>

<p>Every resolution or ordinance must be presented to the Mayor of a city after it
has been passed by the City Council. The Mayor has three choices:</p>

<p>(1) He may approve the ordinance by signing it; it then becomes operative.</p>

<p>(2) He may disapprove the ordinance by vetoing it; he then returns the ordinance
to the clerk of the council with his written objections. The council then
enters the detailed objections in its journal and reconsiders the original resolution
or ordinance in view of such objections. If, after due consideration, two-thirds of
the membership of the council still wishes the original ordinance to pass, it is
passed over the Mayor's veto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) He may do nothing about the ordinance; after five days have passed,
Sundays excepted, if the Mayor is still in office and the term of office of the
members of the city council has not expired, it automatically is passed. If, however,
during these five days, either the term of office of the Mayor or the term
of office of the members of the city council ends, the ordinance is not passed but
is considered "killed."</p>

<p>Like the Governor of the state, the Mayor can veto a particular item or more
than one item in an appropriation ordinance or resolution without affecting the
rest of the resolution or ordinance. Any ordinance or resolution which concerns
the appropriation of money for an amount over one hundred dollars, the levying
of taxes or the authorizing of the borrowing of money can be passed only by a
recorded affirmative vote of a majority of all council members.</p>

<p>The oldest form of city government in Virginia is the Mayor-Council Form.
Under this form, the Council and the Mayor are elected by the qualified voters.
The Mayor, therefore, is the chief executive officer of the city and he either
appoints solely, or with the consent of the city council in some instances, the city
officers not constitutionally required to be elected. He also has the authority to
supervise all city departments and to suspend any officer or employee for cause.
Under this system, the council is the legislative body only.</p>

<p>Another form is the Commission form of local government. Of the three different
types mentioned previously, this form is used in Virginia the least. According
to this plan, the city council itself, elected at large, assumes the legislative and administrative
or executive powers. A mayor is elected from council membership
but he has very limited powers. He is chairman at the council meetings and may
suggest recommendations as possible legislative measures as he sees fit. The city
itself is divided into various administrative departments by the council and each
department is assigned to a different council member who becomes the head
executive or administrative official of that department. Thus, each council member
acts as an administrator individually and as a legislator collectively. The city
council according to this plan carries out the usual functions of the legislative
body and of the executive department, including such functions as determining
the powers of each department and the rules and regulations of each office holder
and employee.</p>

<p>The City Manager form of government was first adopted in the United States
by the city of Staunton in 1908. This is the most widely-used plan found in
Virginia cities at the present time and in many other large cities throughout the
United States. Under this plan, the Council members are elected at large by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the voters. The Council is the legislative body which makes the local laws. The
City Council selects the City Manager who may or may not be an inhabitant of
the town, city or state involved. He not only acts as the chief adviser to the City
Council but also becomes the chief executive in this plan. His term of office is
at the discretion of the City Council members and he is responsible directly to
them. Charles E. Ashburner was the first City Manager in the United States.</p>

<p>The City Council usually elects its own chairman from among its own membership;
this chairman automatically becomes the Mayor of the city. He is the official
titular head of the city and represents the city upon various public occasions. He
presides at Council meetings, has regular Council powers and can vote but cannot
veto a proposed law. In contrast, the City Manager has the power to appoint
the chief officials of the various city government departments, the responsibility
for enforcing city ordinances and resolutions, the obligation of attending City
Council meetings and of making suggestions and recommendations to the Council,
the duty of keeping the City Council informed of general and specific activities
of the city including its financial status, the task of preparing and submitting a
proposed budget to the City Council and the duty of carrying out miscellaneous
functions assigned to him by the City Council.</p>

<p>These three forms&mdash;Mayor-Council, Commission and City Manager&mdash;exemplify
the variety of local government organization available to cities and towns
located in Virginia.</p>

<p>Towns in Virginia in order to be incorporated must have at least 300 inhabitants
and must receive approval of the local circuit judge. Towns still remain part
of the county after their incorporation. At present, there are approximately two
hundred incorporated towns whose functions are carried out and services furnished
by the County and the Town governments. Every town has a Council and a
Mayor and in the large towns, usually a Town Manager. Three other town
officials are a Treasurer, a Clerk (called a Secretary or Recorder) and a Town
Attorney.</p>

<p>Residents of Virginia, consequently, are governed daily by either Town, City
or County levels of government in addition to State and National levels.</p>


<h3><em>Education and Public Instruction</em></h3>

<p>Article IX concerns education. The Constitution specifically states that "The
General Assembly shall establish and maintain an efficient system of public free
schools throughout the State." Therefore, as in all states in United States, the
management of the schools is basically the responsibility of the state. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
State Board of Education consisting of seven members appointed for four-year
terms by the Governor with the approval of the General Assembly. The Governor
with the approval of the General Assembly also appoints an experienced educator
to the chief educational position known as the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
His term of office parallels that of the Governor who appoints him. The
duties and powers of the State Board of Education are constitutionally described
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) to divide the State into school divisions or districts; to certify to the local
school boards within each division a list of persons who have reasonable academic
and business qualifications for division superintendent of schools (the
local school board has the authority to select from this list the individual whom
they wish to hold the position of superintendent of their division for a four-year
term),</p>

<p>(2) to manage and invest the school fund, according to legal regulations,</p>

<p>(3) to make rules and regulations for the management and conduct of the
schools, upon the authority of the General Assembly,</p>

<p>(4) to select textbooks and educational appliances for school use with the
General Assembly itself prescribing the time when textbooks are to be changed
by the State Board of Education.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to the Constitution, each magisterial district is a separate school
district, and the magisterial district furnishes the basis of representation on the
county or city school board. In cities which have a population of at least one
hundred and fifty thousand, school boards have the authority to decide for themselves,
with the approval of the local legislative body, the number and the boundaries
of their school districts. The General Assembly has the right to consolidate
into one school division, if it deems it advisable, one or more counties or cities
with one or more counties or cities. Each division school board is empowered to
select the superintendent of schools for its own division or district. In case a local
school board fails to make such an appointment within a prescribed time, the
State Board of Education then appoints the superintendent in that district.</p>

<p>In 1810 a Literary Fund was created as a permanent fund to be used to defray
educational expenses in Virginia. This money originally came from the proceeds
of public lands donated by Congress for public free school purposes, from unclaimed
property, from property which the state received through forfeiture, from
fines collected for offenses against the state and from other funds appropriated by
the General Assembly. The only money in the fund which must, by constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
requirement, be apportioned on a basis of school population for the benefit of the
primary and grammar school levels is the annual interest on the Literary Fund, one
dollar of the State capitation tax (total State capitation tax, $1.50) and an amount
equal to an annual tax on property of not less than one nor more than five mills
on the dollar. The school population in this instance refers to the number of
children in each school district between the ages of seven and twenty years.</p>

<p>Each school district has the authority to raise additional sums of money for
educational purposes by levying a school tax on property, a maximum amount
being established by the law. The Board of Supervisors in the county area and
the Council in the town or city areas have the authority to levy and collect local
school taxes.</p>

<p>The General Assembly has the right to establish agricultural, normal, manual
training and technical schools as well as other schools deemed desirable for the
public welfare. Virginia colleges under State control at present are the College of
William and Mary at Williamsburg, Longwood College at Farmville, Madison
College at Harrisonburg, Mary Washington College (women's division of the
University of Virginia) at Fredericksburg, Medical College of Virginia at Richmond,
Radford College, (Women's division of Virginia Polytechnic Institute) at
Radford, the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia Military Institute
at Lexington, Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg and Virginia State
College at Petersburg. The State also controls the Richmond Professional Institute
of the College of William and Mary in Richmond, the Norfolk Division of the
College of William and Mary in Norfolk and the Norfolk Division of Virginia
State College in Norfolk. The Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind at
Staunton and the Virginia State School for Colored Deaf and Blind Children at
Newport News are State operated.</p>

<p>The General Assembly also establishes compulsory education. At the present
time, school attendance is not compulsory on a state basis but many communities
have passed local compulsory attendance laws. Whenever a parent or guardian
is financially unable to furnish public school children with necessary textbooks,
the local school system provides free textbooks to such individuals. The Virginia
Constitution has required that there be segregation of white and colored children
in the schools of Virginia. However, as a result of a U. S. Supreme Court ruling
in 1954, the segregation of colored and white children became illegal and unconstitutional.
Consequently, local and state officials throughout Virginia have
been compelled to reconsider the state constitutional provision concerning segregation
in the public schools and to integrate the school population in some areas.</p>

<p>Members of the Board of Visitors and Trustees of educational institutions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate for four-year terms.
They regulate the policy of state-operated institutions of higher learning.</p>


<h3><em>Miscellaneous Provisions</em></h3>

<p>Article X concerns the Department of Agriculture and Immigration which is
headed by a State Board of Agriculture consisting of one practical farmer from
each Congressional district. The president of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
is also automatically an ex-officio member of this board. The chairman of this
board is the Commissioner of Agriculture appointed by the Governor. The Department
of Agriculture and Immigration has three chief functions: to encourage
the production and sale of Virginia farm products, to protect the Virginia farmers
and consumers by carrying out various state laws concerning food products, and
the improvement of such products. The major divisions of this department include
the Division of Chemistry, of Statistics, Dairy and Food, Markets, Animal Industry
and of Plant Industry. The immigration function is now non-existent. This
function was added when a severe labor shortage existed in the latter part of the
1800's: at that time the Commissioner traveled to Ireland, Holland, Belgium and
Denmark in an attempt to get agricultural workers. The department still retains
the name of Agriculture and Immigration but no longer has authority over
immigrants.</p>

<p>Article XI relates to Public Welfare and Penal Institutions. The General Assembly
has the authority to establish and operate public welfare, charitable, sanitary,
benevolent, reformatory or penal institutions. As mentioned in the Executive
section of the Constitution, there is a Department of Welfare and Institutions
which includes a six-member Board of Welfare and Institutions appointed for
a four-year term by the Governor with the approval of the General Assembly.
The Director of this department is the Commissioner of Public Welfare. The
Department of Welfare and Institutions consists of four divisions: the Division
of Corrections which controls the State Penitentiary, the State Farm, the State
Industrial Farm for Women, the Southampton Farm, the State Convict Road
Force and the Bland Correctional Farm; the Division of General Welfare which
helps needy children, elderly individuals, persons who are permanently disabled
physically or mentally, and other miscellaneous cases; the Virginia Parole Board
which has charge of granting parole, revoking parole, releasing qualified persons
on parole and actually discharging individuals considered no longer necessary on
parole; and the Division of Youth Services which supervises children placed in
boarding homes and which operates and controls training schools for minors who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
have committed crimes and have been sent to these schools by court order: the
Beaumont School for Boys (white), the Hanover School for Boys (Negro), the
Bon Air School for Girls (white) and the Janie Porter Barrett School for Girls
(Negro).</p>

<p>Article XII provides that the creation of corporations, as well as amendment
to their charters, be provided by general laws which may be amended or repealed
by the General Assembly. The General Assembly is not permitted to regulate the
affairs of any corporation or to give it any rights, powers or privileges by special
act. The State Corporation Commission is the unit of the state government
through which all charters and amendments are issued. Therefore, the State Corporation
Commission carries out all the provisions of the Constitution and of
the laws for the creation, visitation, supervision, regulation and control of corporations
chartered by, or doing business in, the state. The State Corporation
Commission consists of three members elected by members of the General Assembly
for a six-year term. Among other duties, the commission prescribes rates of
railroads and telephone companies. Because of the numerous incorporated businesses
operating in Virginia, this commission exercises broad, economic authority
on behalf of the welfare of the state.</p>

<p>Article XIII concerns Taxation and Finance. The General Assembly has the
authority for levying taxes, for appropriating revenue, and, in most instances, is
empowered to specify and determine which goods and services shall be taxed
by state and/or local government. All state, local or municipal taxes must be
uniform and must be levied and collected according to general laws. State income
taxes are levied on incomes over six hundred dollars per year. License taxes and
state franchise taxes are levied upon businesses. A state capitation or poll tax of
one dollar and a half is levied on every resident of the state at least twenty-one
years of age; one dollar of which is to be used exclusively for public free schools
and the remainder returned to the county or city treasurer to be used for local
purposes. Local taxes are also levied on real estate and personal property. Property
exempt from taxation by Article XIII includes property owned directly or
indirectly by the Commonwealth or any local unit of government, buildings, land
and furnishings owned and used exclusively for religious organizations or for
benevolent or charitable organizations and private or public burying grounds or
cemetries. Before any money can be paid from the State Treasury, appropriations
must be made by law. No such appropriation can be made which is payable more
than two and a half years after the end of the session of the General Assembly
at which the law is enacted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Article XIV primarily pertains to Homestead Exemptions. Certain homestead
exemptions are authorized. Furthermore, this Article prohibits the General Assembly
from passing a law staying the collection of debts. The General Assembly
is authorized to provide the conditions on which a householder may set apart for
himself and family a homestead on certain property.</p>


<h3><em>The Amendment Process</em></h3>

<p>Article XV describes the Amendment Process. An amendment may be proposed
in either house of the General Assembly: the Senate or the House of
Delegates. It is then voted upon for approval or disapproval. If a majority of the
members of each house vote in favor of the proposed amendment, the amendment
is then referred to the General Assembly at its first regular session held after the
next general election of members of the House of Delegates. The amendment
must then be published for three months previous to election time. Whenever
a majority of all the members in each house vote in favor of the amendment either
in a regular session or in an extra session, the amendment must then be submitted
for approval by the people. If a majority of the qualified voters approve the
amendment at this time, the amendment becomes effective.</p>

<p>Article XV also includes the procedure necessary for calling a constitutional
convention in Virginia. Whenever a majority of the members of each house of
the General Assembly vote for a convention to revise or amend the Constitution,
the question of calling such a constitutional convention must be submitted to the
qualified voters. If a majority of the voters favor such a convention for the specific
purpose included in the original question submitted to the voters, the General
Assembly at its next session must provide for the election of delegates to the
special convention. The qualified voters elect the specific delegates to such constitutional
convention.</p>

<p>Article XVI concerns rules of construction within the constitution itself pertaining
to word usage. Article XVII, already described in this chapter under
Article II, provides for poll tax exemption for members of the armed forces on
active duty.</p>

<p>The original Virginia Constitution of 1776 consisted of 3,000 words. In 1830,
the number of words was doubled with numerous revisions. In 1870, the number
of words was increased six times the number in the original constitution. The
present Constitution which was written in 1902 contains approximately 35,000
words. Consequently, as living becomes more complex, the constitution has become
more lengthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>


<h3><em>State Symbolism</em></h3>

<p>Certain symbols and emblems are approved by various state legislatures which
indicate a particular idea or belief which is soon recognized or identified with a
specific state. The official symbols of the Commonwealth are the State Seals, the
State Motto, the State Flag, the State Flower, the State Song and the State Bird.</p>

<p>There are two state seals: the Great Seal and the Lesser Seal. The official seals
now used in the Commonwealth were adopted and approved by a legislative act
on March 24, 1930. The Great Seal consists of two discs, metallic in nature and
two and one-fourth inches in diameter; there is an ornamental border one-fourth
of an inch in width. On the front or obverse side of the Great Seal is engraved the
figure of Virtus, goddess of courage, garbed as an Amazon representing the
"genius of the Commonwealth." In her right hand, Virtus holds a spear which
points downward toward the earth and upon which she appears to be resting; in
her left hand, she holds a parazonium or sheathed sword which points upward.
The head of Virtus is erect and her face upturned. The left foot of Virtus is placed
on a prostrate figure of a man who represents Tyranny. The head of this symbol
of Tyranny is to the left of Virtus with his distorted tyrannical symbols close by:
a fallen crown, a broken chain and a scourge. At the top of this obverse side is
the word, "Virginia," and at the bottom of the seal in a curved line is engraved
the state motto: "Sic Semper Tyrannis" which translated means "Thus ever to
tyrants," implying that such will be the fate of all tyrants.</p>

<p>On the reverse or opposite side of the Great Seal is engraved a group of three
figures: Libertas, goddess of liberty and freedom, in the center with a wand and
pileus in her right hand, Aeternitas, goddess of eternity, on her right with a globe
and phoenix (a sacred bird) in her right hand and Ceres, goddess of grain and
the harvest, on her left with a sheaf of wheat in her right hand and a cornucopia
(horn of plenty symbolizing peace and prosperity) in her left one. At the top
of the reverse side of the seal in curved line appears the word, "Perseverando."
Originally, the reverse side of the Great Seal had engraved the motto: "Deus
Nobis Pace Olim Fecit" meaning "God gave us this freedom" (Virgil's "Eclogues")
but the motto was changed to the brief word, "Perseverando" in October
1779. George Wythe proposed the original design of the seal and George
Mason originally recommended the motto for the seal at the Williamsburg Convention
in 1776.</p>

<p>The Lesser Seal is one and nine-sixteenths inches in diameter and it consists
of the figures and inscriptions found on the obverse side of the Great Seal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>On March 24, 1930, the present Flag of the Commonwealth was officially
adopted. It consists of a deep blue field with a circular white center&mdash;all of bunting
or merino material. Within this white circle is embroidered or painted, in such
a manner as to appear alike on both sides, the official coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth:
namely, the identical design of figures and inscriptions which appears
on the observe side of the Great Seal of Virginia. The outer edge of the flag, the
one farthest from the flag-staff, is bounded by a white silk fringe.</p>

<p>On March 6, 1918, the General Assembly declared the American Dogwood,
known technically as the Cornus Florida or Flowering Dogwood, as the official
state flower in Virginia.</p>

<p>It was not until 1940 that the state legislature officially adopted its state song.
At this time, "Carry Me Back to Ole Virginny," written by James A. Bland, a
South Carolina Negro, was declared the state song although it had been widely
recognized and sung by many generations of Virginians. The Cardinal, known
technically as the Cardinalis Virginianus, is considered the official State Bird.</p>


<h3><em class="gesperrt">SUMMARY</em></h3>

<p>Fundamental state laws for Virginia are found in a written constitution, originally
adopted in 1776. The United States Constitution provides not only the
framework for our national government but also the relationships between the
national government and the individual states. With the exception of these restrictions,
the state constitution determines the political structure or organization
within the state area and the various powers and functions granted to each governmental
agency. Like all governments established by state constitutions, the
state government of Virginia consists of three departments: the legislative, executive
and judiciary departments.</p>

<p>The Virginia Bill of Rights, written by George Mason, furnished a pattern for
the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution as well as for numerous state
bills of rights. The significance attached to voting even in the early post-Revolutionary
period is obvious by the location of the voting qualifications in the Virginia
Constitution directly following the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>Some unique features about government in Virginia include Section 58 of
Article IV which lists a series of prohibitions on the General Assembly as a protection
for individual liberties, the fact that the Governor cannot succeed himself
(only sixteen states have this restriction), the existence of three types of county
government (the County Executive, the County Manager and the County Board),
the lack of a village form of local government, the existence of thirty-two independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
cities and the existence of three forms of city government (Mayor-Council,
Commission and City Manager).</p>

<p>Other articles in the Constitution concern suffrage, education, public welfare
and penal institutions, taxation and finance, corporations and local government.
Since constitution writers realize that living conditions change from time to time,
the method of making changes in a constitution whenever necessary is included
in the amendment process. Thus, a recent constitutional change was a revision
of Section 141 making it legally permissible to permit the use of public funds
for tuition grants for pupils in private non-sectarian schools. Virginians, like the
residents of other states, will undoubtedly continue to make necessary revisions
when conditions so warrant in order to keep the state governmental structure a
practical, adjustable foundation for a progressively changing society.</p>

<p>When one understands the meaning of the various symbols used by a state in
order to create a specific identity or a particular recognition of its inhabitants and
their ideas, the state seal, motto and flag become more significant to the citizen.
Thus, it is with pride that Virginians show reverence and respect to their
HALLOWED HERITAGE.</p>
